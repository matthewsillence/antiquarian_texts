let me intreate thy furtherance in the fame thus farre,that, inj 
thy neighbouring Churches, if thou (halt finde any ancient' 
funerall Infcriptions, or antique obliterated Monuments, thou 
wouldft be pleafed to copie out the one, and take fo much rela^ 
tiort of the other as tradition can deliuer: as alfo to take the In- 
fcriptions and Epitaphs vpon Tombes and Graueftones 
which are ofthefe times j and withall to take order that fuch 
thy colle^ions,notes, and obfcruations may come fafely to my 
hands • and I (hall reft cuer obliged to acknowledge thy paines 
and curtefie. . , 

And I would earncftly dcfire the Tombe-makers of this 
Citie of London, and elfewnere, that they would be fo care- 
full of pofteritie,as to prefetue in writing the Infcriptions or 
’Epitaphs which they daily engraue ypon Funerall Monu¬ 
ments, from whom I fhall cxpeft the like kindneffe, and to 
whom! will cuer remaine alike thankful!. For, I intend, God 
willing, hereafter to publifh to the view of the world, as well

out all his Maiefties forefaid Dominions, if God fpare me life;

in the fight ot Almighty God, then that of building Churches, 
Oratories, and (uch like facred edifices, for the truefcruiccof 
his hcauenly Maicftie. 

Ethelben the firft (Shriftian King of Kent, hauing built S. 
Pauls Church London, and diuers other Churches and religi¬ 
ous ftrudurcs 5 as 1 fliew hereafter, is thus commended to po- 
fteritie by this Epitaph following, which pafied with applaufc 
no queftion in thofe dayes. 

Pex Ethelbertus hie clauditur in PoJjandrOf 
Fana plans certm Chriflo meat abjquc Meandre, 

King Ethelbert lycth here 
clofed in this Polyander, 

For building Churches fure he goes 
To Chrift without 

The pious carelikewife and gracious intention of our late 
Lord and Soueraigne King lames of famous memory,had,for 
the repairing of the forefaid Church of Saint Pauly and the 
earned defire and purpofc, which’our dread Lord and Soue¬ 
raigne now hath (proceeding out of his zeale to Gods glory 
and his diuine worfliip) for the repairing and vpholding, as 
his Father intended, of that venerable large Fabricke and 
goodly Pyle of building, will be hadin remembrance to all ge¬ 
nerations,and their names will be regiflred in the bookc of the 
lining* ^ 

And the munificent allowance towards the faid worke 
from Wibiam Laudy now Lord Biftiop of London, of one hun¬ 
dred pounds by the ye^re, while he doth contiunc there Biftiop, 
fliall be commended, and had in remembrance of all his Suc- 
cellours for euer. 

It may, perhaps, bee diftaftfiill toibme for that 1 write ib 
fully of the fall and backfliding of Religious Perfons from 
their primitiue zealous ardour ofpie'ty,-making thatthemaine 
caule of the diffolution of Abbeyes: which I doe, for that 
fomearcof opinion, that bccaufc many of thefe Monafteries 
were built vpon theoccafion of rapine and bloud, the Foun¬ 
ders thereby thinking to expiate their guilt, and make fatisfa- 

dion

aion for their finnesv,ancrrour ia point of Diuinitie) thefe 
iacred ftrudurcs howfoeuer confecrated to the feruice of Al¬ 
mighty God, could not ftand faft, nor continue in one and the 
fame Gate for many ages; therefore I thinke it meete and expe- 
dientto difcouer and lay open to the world,the manifold enor¬ 
mities of the profeflcd votaries refiding in liich religious foun¬ 
dations j that it may euidently appeare that it was not the 
finncs of the Founders (of whofe pious intentions we ought 
to haue a more reuerend opinion) that their donations were of 
no longer continuance but that the delinquencies of the reli¬ 
gious Orders thcmfelues, were the foie caufc of their o wne vt- 
tec fubuetfion. 

- I may, perhaps, be found fault withall, becaufe I doe not 
chorographically and according as Churches ftand, neare or 
further remote in one and the fame Lath hundred or wapen- 
tack, emprint and place the Funerall Monuments in this my 
booke; but flip fometimes from one fide of a County to ano¬ 
ther before I emprint an Epitaph. To which giue me leaue to 
makethis anfwer, that hauing found one or two ancient Fu¬ 
nerall infcriptions,or obliterated Sepulchers, in this or that 
•Parifti Church, I haue ridden to ten Parifti Churches diftant 
from that, and not found one. Befides 1 haue beenc taken vp 
in diuers Churches by the Churchwardens of the Parilh, and 
not fufFered to write the Epitaphs, or to take view of the Mo¬ 
numents as I much defired, for that I wanted a Commifllon; 
which would greatly haue encouraged me f and ftillit would^ 
as that of Henry the eight did lobn Leyland,ia the prolequution 
of this bufinefle. 

I conclude the Epitaphs and Funerall inlcriptions in this 
booke as I finde them engrauen, with ac«t«tf anime papitietur 
Dem : or with God pardon his foule j which fome may fay 
might haue becne as well left out ofmy booke, as they are in 
many places foraped out of the brafie: And I write the Latine 
in the iamemanneras 1 finde it either written or imprinted, as 
capttd for capup, niebil for nibilf and the like;as alfo E vocall,for 

E dipthong, dipthongs being but lately come into vie. And

And king ofluda, dept with his fathers, and they buried him 

with his fathers, in the field of the buriall which pertained to the kings.

who did feefo much of the ruines thereof, as time hath not dcuoured. 

The Athenians buried luch as were flainc in battcll,and other honoura¬ 
ble perfonages, in a place without the Citie called Ccramnicus. 

So here in England, the interments of the dead were anciently farre out 
of all Townes and Cities, cither on the ridges of hills, or vpon Ipatious 
plaincs, fortified or fenced about, with obelisks, pointed ftoncs,Pyramids,

It was a thing vfuall among our old Saxon anceftours (faith Verjlegatf) 
as by Tacitus it alfo feemeth to haue bccnc among the other Gcrmans.that 
the dead bodies of filch as were flaine in the field, and buried in the fields,

Cutbbert oxCudbright of that Province, ob¬ 

tained from the Pope a difpenfation, for tbe making of Goemiteries or 
Churchyards within Townes, and Citick, whercas,hercin England, vntill 
his time, within the walls thereof none were buried. Thefe following are

Chap. IHI. 

Of the excefiue expenfes beflowed at FmeraUs 
in foYmer times. 

T Might include within this Chapter, and not impertinently, to thefe con- 
Itenfs, the ancient cuftomes, and manners of burying the dead, in all Na¬ 
tions, throughout all the habitable world: but that would make the gate 
bigger then the citic, this difeourfe of a greater bulke, then all the reft ot the 
booke befides: you may finde this Treatife touched vpon, in the Voluir.nc 
of the Eftatcs,Empires,and Principalities of the worldjas alfoin the Trca- 
furic of Ancient and modernc Times, the ftxtb booke • where hcc fpeakes 
ofdiucrs cuftomes and fafhionsof buriall, of ancient oblcquies, and their 
ceremonies; onely then a little offo much,becaufe 1 would notftray be¬ 
yond my limits. 

The ancient Romanes did vfe them that were dead after two manners, 
and they had two kindes of obfequiesrthe iirftand moft ancient was to 
couer the dead with earth, and to bury them as we doe- the other, to burne 
their bodies, but this manner did not continue long SefeUriantiquiids fu~

nour which they vied to performe in theobfequies pffamous pcrrons,was 
to commend the partic by an Oration. Faler 'tus PuhlicoU made a funerall 
oration on the death and in the praife of Brutm. In like manner luhus Cd- 
fit, being but twelue ycares old, commended his grandfather; and Tiberius 
at the ageof nine yearcs praifed his father.The fecund honour was to make 
Sword-players to fight. Marcus and Decius fbnncs to lunius Brutus, were 
the firft that did pra^ife this, in honour of their father. The third honour 
was, to make a feaft of magnificent furniftiment. The fourth was a dsftri- 
bution of meat to all the common people. And fuch (as I haue faid beforej 
as could not be buried with the like, and fo great pompc (for the expenfes 
were infupportable) were buried in the night time, by the Vcfpillons do- !

Many more ceremonies were obferued in the magnificent ordering of 
bothkindesof Funerails,as wellof fuchaswcrc buried in the earth, as of 
thefe burned in thcfecoftly piles of wood. The cuftome of burning the 
dead bodies continued among the Romanes, but vntill the time of the An- 
tonine Emperours, An Do. 200. or thereabouts; then they began to buiie 
againein ihQQdxth.Manutim del&lt;g,Rom.fil 125. 126, 

They had, at thefe burials, fuborned counterfeit hired mourners, which 
were women of the loudcft voices, who betimes in the morning did meetc 
at appointed places, and then cried out mainly, beating of their breafts, 
tearing their haire, their faces, and garments, ioyning'thcrcwith the pray¬ 
ers of the defunff, from the houre of his natiuitie, vnto the houre of his 
diflolution; ftill keeping time with the melancholickc mufickc. (This is a

fwcet odours, precious oyles, perfumed fcrcclothes, fine Aromaticke Sin- 
don, and the like. The mourners were exceeding many, (of which I haue 
partly fpoken before) with Trumpeters, and Mufitians of all forts, moft 
dolefully founding, and warbling forth their lamentable notes: the corps 
of the defund being garded, and attended vpon, with troupes of horfe- 
men, which was accounted an extraordinaric kinde of honour done to the 
dcccafed: then laft of all, Funerall Games, Bonefires of moft precious 
woods. Orations, magnificent, fumptuous, and moft royall fcafts and ban¬ 
quets were ordained. 

But thelc excefliue charges, thele fuperfluous and impertinent cofts of

and Grecians, and funerall charges proportioned, according tothewor- 
thinefle of the perfbn deceafed, and his mcancs j anfwerable to the valua¬ 
tion of his ycarely reuenues, or the generall eftimate of his fubftancc. 

In like manner thefcEthnicke lamentations, and fcarefull bowlings for 
the dead, by hired mourners, were prohibited; yet moderate weeping and 
mourning at Funeralls^was neuer diffallowed} nay it hath been cuer highly 
commended, accounted thcchiefc grace of Funerals, promifed for a bleF 
fing to the godly, and thewant thereof, a maledi&lt;ftion orcurfcj and mo¬ 
derately to mournc after the interment of our friends, is a manifeft token 
of true louc; by it wee cxprelTe that naturall affc(ft:ion wee had to the de¬

to God'ward is demonftrated. For as God hath made vs liuing,fo hath he 
made vs louing creatures, to the end we Ihould not be as ftocks and ftones, 
voide ofall kinde and naturall affe(ftion, but that liuing and louing together,

me and more alfb, if I taftc bread, or ought clfe till the Sunne bee do wnc:

Our all perfect and Almighty Sauiour Chrift lefus, wept ouerthe grauc 
of dead L^zarm (whom he rcuiued) wheruponthe ftanders by faid among 
themfelues, behold how he loiied him. 

The ancient Romanes, before they were Chriftians, mourned nine 
monechs, but being Chriftians, they vfed mourning a whpleyeare,clothed 
in blacke for the^ moft part, for women were clothed partly in white, and 
partly in blacke, according to the diucrfitie of Nations. And if any Chri- 
ftian, man, or woman, inthofe parts, wearing mourning, came to agree 
againe in afecond marriage, during the yeafe appointed for mourning, the 
Matrimony was flayed, but thenceforward hcc nor fhec were bound to 
weare any more mourning. 

Thefe examples confldered, I obferuc that wee, in thefe dayes, doe not 
wcepe and mourne at the departure of the dead, fo much, nor fo long, as in 
Chriftian dutie we pught.For husbands can buric their wkics, and wiucs 
their husbands, with a few counterfeit teares,anda fbwre vifltgc masked 
and painted ouer with diflimulation; contrading fecond marriages, before 
they hauc worne out their mourning garments, and fometimes before 
their cope mates be cold in their graues.

The like reafon moued Hadrian to build his Tombe or Sepulchre neare

And to bring you this honie example, the like confideration moued 
King Henry the (euenth, in the eighteenth yeare of his ra'gne, to build that

Monuments prouided in their life time. 

Great hath been the care of buriall f faith Cam dm) cucr fince the firft 
times, infomuch that Fathers would lay charges vpon their children, con» 
cerning the buriall, and tranflating of their bodies, eucry one being dc(i.

lacoh at his death charged his (bnne Jofeph to carry his body into the (c- 
pulchrc of his fathers. And Jofeph himfelfe commanded his brethren that 
they fhould remember and tell their pofieritie, that when they went away 
into the land of promife,they fhould carry his bones thither with them. 
AbrahamHfaac^lacobySarah^Kebecca^Leah’^m'di lofephy were buried to¬

The kings of iEgypt accuftomed to awe their fubic£ts by threatning to 
depriucthem ofburiall. And it was a penal tie of the law amongft the Ro¬ 
manes. He that doth this, or that, let him be cafi forth vnburied- and foin

A S in former times the moft of all Nations were ardently defiroos of 
xVdecenc buriall^ Co Hiftories doe Qicw that the Ancients, and namely 
the Egyptians, were no Icflc carefull, and curious to prcfeiue whole and 
entire, the bodies of the dead laid within their Sepulchres, and to keepc 
them from putrifaf^ion.fo much as they could poffib-'e, \^hich they did by 
this mcanes. So fbone as any one amongtt them (efpccially of exemplary 
note) was dead, they would draw out the braines of chedefunifl-, at the no- 
ftrils,withaninftrumcnt of iron, replcni(Iiing the fame with preferuatiue 
fpices ^ then cutting vp the belly with an Ethiopian done, called Lai^nc, 
i and extraiElingthe bowels, they clcanfed the infide with wdne, and fluffing 
i the fame with a compofition of Caffia,myrrhe,and other odoufs, clofcd it 
againc. The like the poorer fort of people t ffeded with Bitumen (as the in’" 
fide oftheir skuls and bellies yet teftifie, faith Sandy s, lib. ^ who faw fuch 
their ftrangc embalmed bodies) fctcht from the lake of Afphaftis in Jury. 
So did they by the iuyee of Cedars, which by theextreame biirefnefle and 
ficcatiue qualitie, notoncly fubdued (forthwith) the caufeofinreriour cor- 
ruption,but hath to this day (a continuance ofaboue three thoufand ycares) 
preferued them vneorrupted. Within their bellies (bcfidcs their odorous 
compofitions) they enclofed certaine painted papers^ and ftrange fliapcs of 
their Gods, in little models of flone or mettall; this done, they wrapt the 
bodic with linen in multitudes of folds, befmeared with gumme in manner 
of a feare-cloth.fwathled with bands of the fame; ftaining their bVeafts 
with Hierogliphycull chara&lt;5fcrs • and fb laid them downc in futh vaults,

there was found in a ccrtaine wood ncarc to Nuremburgh very ancient 
Tombes, and amongft the bones of the dead,nailes and buckles of bralTc.

found, and taken vp in Rome,intirc and found in all parts,to thegreat afto' 
niftiment of the beholders, in that it had triumphed fo many ages oucr all 
corruption. At his head was found ^ a burning lampe,which could not bee 
extinguilht, neither by violence of blaft, nor by afperfion of liquor. Vpon 
whole tombe this Epitaph following was then found.

Within the ParifhofStepney in Midlcfcx, in Radcliffe field, where they 
take baliaft for fhips; about fbme fburtccne or fiftecnc ycares agoe, there 
was found two Monuments, the oneof (lone, wherein was the bones of a 
man, the other a cheft of leai the vpper part being garnilhed with Scallop 
fhels, and a crocifter border. At the head of the coffin, and the foot, there 
were two lars, ofa three foot length, ftanding, and on the fidcs a number of 
bottles of gliftering red earth, fome painted, and many great viols of glafle, 
fome fixc,rome eight fquare; hauingawhitilh liquour within them. With¬ 
in the cheft was the body of a woman, as the Ghirurgians iudged by the 
skull. On cither fide of her, there was cwofeepters of luory, eightcenc 
inches long, and on her breaft a little figure of Cupid neatly cut in white 
ftonc.And amongft the bones two printed pccces of lctt,with round heads 
in forme of nailcs three inches long. 

It feemeth (faith Robert Con on^fiom whom I had this relation) thefe 
bodies were burned about the yeareof our Lord 2351 being, there were 
found diucrscoines of Pupenm^ Gordian^ and the Emperours of that time. 
And that one may conicAure by her ornaments, that this laft body fbould 
be fome Princes or Propretors wife here in Britainei in the time of the Ro- 
raanegouernment. 

In the North ifle of the Parifti-church ofNewport paincll in Bucking- 
hamfbire, intheyeare i 6 ip. was found the body ofa man wholeand per- 
fed 5 laid downc, or rather leaning downc. North, and South; all the con- 
cauous parts of his body,and the hollowneffc of :uery bone,as well fibs as 
other, were filled vp with follid lead. The skull with the lead in it doth 
weigh thirty pounds and fixe ounccs,which with the neck-bone,and fbme 
other bones (in like manner full of lead) arc refcrued,and kept in a little 
cheft in the faid Church, ncarc to the place where the corps were found; 
there to bee fhowne to ftrangers as reliques of admiration. The reft of all 
the parts of his body are taken away by Gentlemen nearc dwellers, or fiich 
as take delight in rare Antiquitics.This I faw. 

Thus you fee by the premifes,how magnificent our Ancients were in 
theordering and expenfes ofFuncrals; how fumptuous in their houfes of

putrifa^lion; for fo much as the foulc, faith SandySy knowing it felfeby di- 
uine inftin^limmortal),doth defire that the body (her beloued companion) 
might cnioy (as farre forth as may be) the like felicity, giuing, by ereaing 
lofty Monuments, and thefe dues of Funcrall, all pofflble eternitie. 

But now iudicious Reader vndcrftand, that howfoeuer I haue fjjoken, or 
whatfbeuer I fballfpeake hereafter of buriall, and the ceremonies thereun¬ 
to bclonging^yet I fpeake now out of Saint Augufiine and Ludomeus Vines 
' his Commentofy that it is not preiudiciall to a Ghrlftian fbhle to bee forbids 
den buriall. For although the Pfalmift complaines (as I haue faid before) 
how that none would bury the dead bodies of Gods feruants 5 yet this was 
fpoken to intimate their villany which did it; rather then their mifery 
which fuffered it. For though that vnto the eyes of man,thefe atls feeme 
bloudy and tyrannous, yet precious in the fight of the Lord is the death of 
his Saints. And our faith, holdingfaft the promife, is not fo frailcas to 
thinkc that the rauenous beafts can depriuethe body of any part to bee 
wanting in therefurre^fion; where hot a haire of the head (hall be miffingj 
a new reftitution of our whole bodies'beihg promifed to all ofvs in a mo¬ 
ment, not oncly out of the earth aIonc,buteuen out ofthe moft fecrct an¬ 
gles of all the other elements, wherein any body is or can bee pofflbly' in¬ 
cluded. A bad death ncucr followes a good life, for there is nothing that 
maketh death bad, but that eftate which followcth death. What power 
then hath the horrour of any kindc of death, or the want of buriall, to af¬ 
fright their foules that haue led a veftuous life I loco^ quo mdo , (quo

The familic ofthe gorgeous rich glutton, prepared him a fumptuous fu- 
nerall vnto the eyes of men, but one farre more fumptuous, did the mini- 
ftring Angels prepare for the vlccrcdbcgger,inthe fight of God. They 
bare him not into any Sepulchre of marble, but placed him in the bofome 
of Ahraham. 

Lucans Pharfalia, the ninth booke, fpeaking ofetcat P ompejy who wan

And the faid'z»r4« in his feuenth booke,fpeaking of the dead, that

by men, whofe memory is cfteemed,or mentioned in (lories, doth moue

With the like defire (or more then they haue to (ce thefe old Cities en¬

or hearcs how (patious, how populous,how plenteous, and liow fa.'re

wherein the facred afbes of fo many of the Lords anointed, befidc other 
great Potentates arc entombed. A fight which brings delight and admira¬

We defire likewife to behold the mournfull ruincs of other religious 
houfes, although their goodly fairc ftru^fiircs bee altogether deftroyed, 
their tombes battered downe, and the bodies of their dead caff out of their 
coffins; for that, that very earth which did fometimes couer the corps of 
the defunct, puts vs in mindc ofour mortalitie, and confequcntly brings vs 
to vnfained repentance. What numbers of Citizens and others at this very

Chap. IX. 

Of the punifhments both by humane lasoesy and Gods feuereiuflicey 
injliSted ypon Juch malefaSlors inforegoing agesy^ho yio-^ 
lated Sepulchers. Of Qurcb-robbers. 

' I ^Ho(c(in foregoing ages^ which did violate, mifufe,or diftaine tombes, 

1 ^ graucsjfcpulchers, or any of thefe funerall Monuments, were punifhed 
either with death, perpctuall exile, condemnation to the mines,banifhracnt 
for a time, payment of money, forfeiture of goods, Ioffe of racmbers,or the 
like, according to the qualitie of thcpcrfon,andcircumftance of the fad.To 
begin with the Clergie. 

A Prieft found guiltieofthis execrable a&lt;a (being fo much more odious, 
by how much his place was reputed more honourable and religious j was 
degraded from his Priefthood, his goods fct to open fale,and forfeited, and 
himfelfe condemned to perpetuall baniftiment. 

If a man of eminent place, of great riches, rankc, and qualitie, did with 
an armed hand, defpoile any Tombe or Sepulchre, after the 

manner of an high-way robber, that man by the Law was put to executi- 
onj ifvnarmed, then the ludge did fend him to the Mines, or to banifh- 
ment, or punilh him with fome pecuniarie mul^l, to the value, moft com¬ 
monly,of halfe his goods, and branded him ^ith eternall infamie. 

If a Seruant,oraman ofmcanc fortunes,was knowne to pull downc,or 
defaceany funerall Monument, without his mafterspriuitie, hee was con¬ 
demned to the Minesj if hee had bcenc vrged thereunto by hismafter, then 
he was adiudged for a time to be banifhedjif he did digge vp^and draw out 
of the grauc, the body or bones of the defun^f, then his iudgement was 
death. 

If any man did deface,or cut away any part of the Effigies orreprefenta- 
tion of the defun6f, caru’d,cngraucn, oremboft, vpon any graue-ftone, 
tombe, or fepulchre, that man by the law was to lofc his hand. 

Whofoeuer in the repairing ofany ruinous decayed Sepulchre, did any 
way vndeccntly touch the body of the dead perfon, therein laid downe to 
his eternall reft.* that party fo offending, was commanded by the Law, De- 
cempondoauriFifio to bring ten pound weight of gold into the 

Exchequer; 

But the rapft execrable and hellifh abufc of all other offered to the dead, 
is effected by witchcraft,incantation, and Art-magiclccjanart/aith ^in- 
BecUm* 15. which is laid to difquietthe Gods, to trouble and dif-

downc,and caft out of all Churches, Roodes, grauen Images,Shrines with

any thing elfe, which (punftually) tended to idolatric and fuperftition.Vn-

rooted vp, and battered downe, Crofles in Churches, and Church-yards, 
as alfo in other publike places, they defaced and brake downe the images of

crackt a peeces the glaflc-windowes wherein the effigies of our blelTed Sa-

other wife turned vp their hccles into the place where their heads vfed to be

They defpoilcd Churches of their copes, veftments, Amices, rich bang¬

for Summer and warmer for Winter- he tgoke iikewife away from t/ilfcu- 
Upifis his golden beard, faying it was afaucic part for him cohaiie a long 
beard, and his father Apvllo to haue none. But this his fcofSng facriledgc 
waspuniihed in his fonne Dionyfms^ who was enforced to flie out of his 
owne kingdome; to trudge vp and downe like a runneagarc, and in the end 
to leade a priuate life at Corinth. S'eldome faith one, the children of them 
profper, that fcornc the falfe Gods,and beleeue not in the true God. And 
how the pofteritieofehefeGommiffioners haue profpered vpon earth, or 
how puniQicd after death, God knowes all, howfoeuer by men fomewhat 
in their pafiTages hath beene obferued. For thefe hote-burning in zeale of ! canA. in si,ff

preferred their priuate refpeds, and their owne enriching, before the ho¬

This Proclamation was ieconded by another, to the fame purpofe, in 
the fourteenth yearcofher Maiefties raigne, charging the luftice's of her 
Affife to prouidc (cucre remedie, both for the punilhment and reformation 
thereof. 

But thefe Proclamations tooke finall cffe&lt;3:, for much what about this 
time, there fprung vp a contagious broode of Scifmatickes; whojftley 
might haue had their wills, would not onely haue r )bb: d our Churches o 
all their ornaments and riches, but alfo haue laid them kuell with the

ronious doffrines, in (brae emptie barne, in the woods, or common fields, 
then in thele Churches, which they held to be polluted with the abhomi- 
nations ofthc whore of Babylon. 

Befides about that time thefe forefaid wilfull Sci^aries did penne, print, 
and fpread abroad ccrcaine feditious Pamphlets (as ftill they doe^ againft

vniforme cry into Cheapenearc vnto the GrolTc j and there finding the 
throng and preafeof people to increaft about ihem/in fuch fort as they 
could not well pafle further, nor be conuenicntly heard ot them all as they 
defired .• they got them vp into an eraptie pcafe^cart; wherein they fiood 
notonely vpon the words of their former cricj but reading fomething out 
of a paper, they went more particularly ouer the office and calling of 
ket, ho w he reprefented Chrift, by partaking apart of his glorified bodie, 
by his principall fpirit, and by the office of fcuering thegood from the bad. 
And that they were two Prophets, the one of mercy, the other of iudge^ 
ment, called and fentof God,toaffift this^their Chrift in his great 

worke. Thefe men were apprehended the fame day .The 2^. of July Backet 
was arraigned, and found guiltie, as to haue fpoken diuers moft falfe and 
traiterous words againft her Maieftie^tohaue razed and defaced her Aimes, 
as alfo her picture, thrufting an iron inftrument into that part which did 
reprefent thebreaft and heart, por the which he had iudgemcnt,and on the 
2 8. of July, bee was brought from Newgate, to a gibbet by the Crofte in 
Cheape; where being moued to aske God and the Qi^ene fbrgiuenefte, he 
fell to railing and curfing of the Queene, and began a moft blafphemous 
prayer againft the diuine Maieftic of God. They had much ado to get him 
vp the jadder; where hec was hanged, and after bowelled and quartered. 
His execrable fpeeches and demcanure as well at his arraignment, as death, 
vtterly diftained and blemifhed all his former feeming fanditie-^ wherewith 
he had fhroudly poflefTed the common people. Thus you fee how eafily 
ignorant people arc feduced by falfe new doctrines, how fuddenly they fall 
from true Religion into herefie,frenfic,and blarphemie^robbing the Church 
of all her due rites, and (as much as in them lies) God of his ^ory; which 
abufc, of thefe times, I leaue to be reformed by our reuerend Clergie. 

On the next day (to make an end of the Story) Edmund Cofpngcr' ha

in Bridewell. And Henry x^rthingtorAyrng in the Counter in Wood-

To the gouernment of thefe forefaid holy Fabric ks,and their reuenucs,fuch 
men were chofen as were the beft learned,and moft eminent forintegritic 
oflife. The Priefts confecrated by the impofition of handstand appointed 
to fey prayers, admiriifter the Sacraments, inftrud the Chrittians which 
daily increafed jand to execute all fuch offices as belonged to a fecred Biftiop 
or venerable Paftour, were in fuch high and holy repute amongft the lay- 
people, as that when any of them were efpied abroad, they would flocke 
prefently about him, and with all reucrence humbly befeech his Benifons, 
either by figning them with the crolTe, or in holy prayers for them. And 
further ffaith Bede)\i was the manner in thofeprimi due times,of the people 
ofEngland, that when any of the Clergie, or any prieft came to a village, 
they would all by and by,at his callings come together, ro hearc the word, 
and willingly hearken to fuch things as wcrcfeid,and more willingly fol¬ 
low in workes, fuch things as they could heareand vnderftand. A wonder- 
full order ofpietic both in prieft and people. 

Chaucer in the prologue, to his Canterbury Tales,giues vs the chara£fcr 
of a religious and learned prieft, who in his holy actions did imitate the ex¬ 
ample ofthe Clergie of thefe times, wI;iereof I hauefpoken; but fuch were

ncuer came then to Church,but onely to pray and hearc the word of God.

the ordinary and daily diet. For then thofe learned men and rulers of the 
Church, fought not to pamper the panch, but to fauc the foule ^ not to 
pleafe the world, but to ferue God. . 

Wherefore it came then topafTe, that cuen thehabitc of religious men 
•was at that time had in great reuerencc-fo that w'here any of the Clergie or 
religious perfoncame, he fliould bee ioyfully receiued of all men, like the

them, Vpon theSondayes ordinarily the people flocked to the Church, 
or to Monafteries, not for belly-cheare, but to heare the word of God; 
And if any Prieft came by chance abroad into the village, the inhabitants 
thereof would gather about him, and defire to haue fomc good Icilon or

But I will conclude this Chapter with the words of Camden, fpcaking 
ofthe Monafticall life and profeffion. 

The profeffion ofthis Monafticall life (faith he^ began when Pagan Ty¬ 
rants enraged againft Chriftians, purfued them with bloudy perfecurions. 

For then good deuout men, that they might ferue God in more fafety and 
fecurity, withdrew themfelucs into the vaft wilderneffes of Egypt, and not 
(as the Painims are wont with open mouth to giiie it out) for to enwrap 
themfelues willingly in more miferies becaufe they would not be in miferie. 

Where they fcattered themfelues among mountaincs and defarts, lining 
in caues and little cells, here and there in holy meditations. At firft folitary 
and alone.* whereupon in Greekethey were called Monaebi,isMonkes: 
but after they thought it better (as the fociable nature of mankinde requi¬ 
red) to mectc together at certaine times to ferue God, and at length they 
began to cohabite and liue together for mutuall comfort, rather then like 
wildebcafts to walke vp and downe in the defarts. Their profeffion was 
to pray, and by the labour of their owne» hands to get lining for themfelues, 
and maintenance for the poore,and withal! they vowed pouerty,obedience, 
and chaftitie. \^thanafim firft brought this kindc ofMonkes, confifting 
of lay-men, into the Weft-Church. Whereunto after that Saint Aujlen in 
Afrike. Saint CMartin in France?, and Congett (one of the Col ledge of.' * 
Bangor) in Britaine and Ireland, had adioyned the funftion of regular 
Clergic. It is incredible how farre and wide they fpread, how many and 
how great Coenobies were built for them, fo called of their communion of 
life: as alfb Monafterics,for that they kept ftill a certaine (hew of folitaric 
lining: and in thofe dayes none were more facred and holy then they, and 
accordingly they were reputed; confidering how by their prayers to God^ 
by their example, dofirine, labour, 3 nd induftrie, they did exceeding much 
good, notoneiy to themfelues,but alfo to all mankinde. But as the world 
grew wor/e and worfe, fo thofe their holy manners, as one faid, rebus cejfe&gt; 
re fecundisy that is, Gaue backward in time of profperitic. 

But of the pietie of religious profefTours in the Primitiue tinics, of the 
fanditie of Britifh and Saxon Kings, of their Qucencs, and iflue royall; as 
alfo of other pcrfbns of cxemplaric zeale and holy conuerfation; I doc 
fpeake hereafter in particular, as I come to the places of their interments.

Archbifbop of Canterbury , by the counfell of Pomface BiHoop of 
Mentz, called a Conuocation at Cliffe befide Rochefier,to reforme the ma¬ 
nifold enormities wherewith the Church of England at that time was 
ouergrowne. Our kings forfaking the companieof their owne wines, in 
thofe dayes delighted altogether in harlots, which were for the mod part 
Nunnes. The reft of the Nobilitie following their example, trode alfo the 
fame trace. The Bifhops like wife,and other of the Glcrgie,that Qiould haue 
beenc a meanes of the reforming thefe faults in others, were themfclues no 
lefTc faultie; fpending their times either in contentions and brables, or elfe 
in luxurie and voluptuoufnefTc, hauing no care of ftudy,and feldome or ne- 
uer preaching- Whcreb3uc came to pafle, that the whole land wasouer- 
whclmed,withamoftdarke and palpable mift of ignorance, and polluted 
with all kindcofwickedneffe and impictie, in all forts of people. In which 
Canuocation, after long confultation with thofe his Difliops, or SufFra- 
gancs, and the reft of the CIcrgie which were holden in greateft efteeme 
for their learning, in number thirtie, for the reformation of thefe horrible 
abufes, endeauouring thereby flike a good Paftour) to turne away the 
wrath of God which feemed to hang ouer this land, and to threaten thofe 
plagues which not long after fell vpon it, when the Danes inuaded the 
fame. 

£^/^4r,rurnamcd the pcaceabIe,King of England in theyearc,y^p.called 
together his Bifhops, and other of his Clergic, to whom hee made this or 
the like Oration, as followeth. 

Forfomuch as our Lord hath magnified his mercy to worke with vs it 
is meece (moft reucrend Fathers) that with worthy workes weanfwcr his 
innumerable benefits: for neither by our ownefword poflefTc we the earth, 
and our owne armes hath not faued vs5 but his right hand and his holy

fubmit both our fclues and our foules to him, that hath put all things vn- 
der our feet; and that we diligently labour that they whom he hath made 
fubic^lvnto vs, may bee made fubiedvnto his lawes. And truly it is my 
part to rule the Laitie, with the law of cquitie, to doc iuft iudgement be¬ 
twixt man and his neighbours, to punifh Church-robbers, to reprefTe re¬

wards them which bee abroad, if in diuine feruice they bee carefull, if in 
teaching the people diligent, ifin feeding fober, if moderate in apparell,if in 
iudgement they be difereet. If you had cured thefe things by prudent feru * 
tinie (by your licence I fpeake O reuerend Fathers ) fuch horrible and ab- 
hominablc things of the Clerkes had not come to our cares. I omit to 
fpeake, that their Crownc is not large, nor their rounding conuenient, but 
wantonneflein apparclUnfolencie in behauiour^filthinclTc in words, doc 
bewray the madnefle ofthe inward man. Furthermore, how great negli¬ 
gence is there in the Diuines, when in the holy Vigils, they will fcarce 
vouchfafetobeprefent, when at the holyfolemnities of thediuinc-fcruice, 
they feeme to bee gathered together to play and to laugh, rather then to 
fing. 

I will fpeake that which good men lament,and euill men laugh at. I will 
fpeake with forrow (iffo be it may be fpoken) how they flow in banquet- 
tings, in chambering and wantonncfle,that now Glerkcs houfes may bee 
thought to be brothell- houfes of harlots, and an aflcmbly ofplaiers. There 
is dice, there is dancing and finging, there is watching till midnight, with 
crying and fhouting. Thus the patrimony of Kings, the almes of Princes, 
yea (and that more is) the price of that precious bloud is ouerthrownc 
Had our fathers therefore for thispurpofc emptied their treafures? hath the 

1 Kings bountifulneffe giuen lands and poflefflons to Chriftian Churches 
j for this end? that Glcrkes harlots Qiould be pampered with delicious dain- 
i tics, that riotous gnefts may be prepared for; that hounds and bawkes,and 
fuch like toyes may begotten. Ofthis the Souldiei scry out, the common 

I people murmure, the iefters and fcoffers fing and dance, and you regard it 
not- you fparc it, you diflemblc it. W here is the fword of Zeujy and zeale of 
Simeon^ which killed the circumcifedSichiraites, being the figure of them 
that defile the Church of Ghrift, with polluted a6ls, abufing lacobs daugh¬ 
ter as an harlot ? Whereis the fpirit of that fpared not his houf- 

hold, kinsfolke worQiipping the head ofthe calfc? Where is the dagger of 
Phinets the Priefi, who killing him that played the harlot with the Madia- ' 
nitc,with this holy emulation pacified Gods wrath ? where is the fpint of 
Peter y by whofe power couccourncffe is deftroyed, and Simoniall herefie 
condemned? Endcauour to imitate, O ye Priefts in God: It is time to rife 
againft them that hauc broken the Law of God. I haue ConUmtineSy you 
hauc Peters fword in your hands, let vs ioyne right hands, let vs couple 
fwordtofword, that the Leapers may bee caft out ofthe Church, that rhe 
hallowed place of our Lord may bee purged, and the fbnncs of Leui may 
miniftcr in the Church. Go to carefully, I befccch you, left it repent vs to 
haue done that which we hauc done, and to hauc giuen that which wee 
hauc giuen, if we (hall fee that not to be fpent in Gods feruice, but on the 
riotoufncfTc of moft wicked men, though vnpuniftied libertie. Let the re- 
liqucsof holy Saints, which they fcornc, and the reuerend Altars before 
which they rage, mouc you.- Let the maruellous dcuotion of our Ancc- 
ftoursmouc you, whofe almes the Clerkes furic abufcthj&amp;c. To you I 
commit this bufinefre,that both by Biftioplic ccnfure,and kingly authority,

Not long after, to* wit, in the raigne of Etheldred^QommovXy called/Fhe 
vnready,it was foretold by an holy Anchorite- that fbrfomuch as the peo» 
pie of this Nation were giuen oucr to all drunkcnneire,treafon, and carelef- 
nelTe of Gods houfe ifirft by Danes, then by Normans, and laft of all by 
the Scots they lliould be ouercome. Of which hereafter. 

Edrvard iht Confeffor, whileft he lay ficke of thatfickneffe whereof he

fantafticall illufion, but a true vifion which I haue feene, grant me (pace to 
vtter the fame vnto thefe thatftand here prefent, or die not. And herewith 
hauing his fpecch perfcd,he declared how he had feene tw'o Monkes Hand 
by him, as he thought, whom in his youth he knew in Normandie to haue 
lined godly, and died Chriftianly.Thefe religious mcn(faid he) proteftmg 
to me that they were the melTengers of God^fpake thefe words.Bccaufe the 
chiefe gouernoursofEngland,theBilhops,and Abbots, are not the mini, 
fters of God, but the dcuils, the Almighty God hath deliuered this king- 
dome for oneyearc and a day into the hands of the enemy, and wicked fpi- 
rics (hall walke abroad through the whole land. And when I made anfwer 
that I woulddcclarc thefe things to the people, and promifed on their bc- 
halfe, that they fhould doc penance in following the example of the Nini- 
aites: they faid againc,that it would not be, for neither fhould the people 
repent, nor God take any pitic vpon them. And when is there hope to haue 
an end of thefe miferies? laid I: Then faid they, when a greene tree is cut in 
funder in the middle,and the part cut off, is carried three acres breadth from 
the ftockc, ana returning .againe to the ftoalc, /hall ioyne therewith, and be¬ 
gin to bud and bcare fruit after the former manner, by reafon of the fap re¬ 
newing the accuftomed nourifhmcnt, then (wee fay) may there bee hope 
that fucheuils (ball ceafe anddiminilh. With thefe words of the dying 
king, though many that flood by were ftruckc with feare 5 yet Stig and the 
Church-chopper, Archbifhop of Canterbury, made but a ieft thereof,fay- 
ing, that the old man doted, and raued now in his lickneffe. Neuerthe- 
lefTc within the fiime yeare the truth of this propheticall dreamc or vifion 
did plainly appearc. When theconquerour wiRUm feized into his hands, 
to glue vnto the Normans, the moft part of eucry manspofftflionsin Eng¬ 
land* tooke from the Bifhops Secs all their ancient priuiledges and free,

fes, with their reuenucs to himfclfc, dhgrading and depriuing as well Bi¬ 
fhops, as Abbatsoftheir feats and honours, and detaining many of them 
in prifon during their Hues, that othcfj of his owne followers might bee 
placed in their roomes. By which meancs there was fcarce left any man in 
authoriticofrhe E glifhmation to bcare rule ouer the rcfljinfomiich that it

Richard CordeliorjyVmg ofEngland,being ^old by a certaine Prieft called 
FulcOyZ Frenchman, that he kept with him three daughters,namely, pride,

if he did not Ihortly rid himfelfcof them; anfwereixhat he wouldprcfcnt- 
lybeftow his three daughters in marriage 5 the Knights Templcrs (faid

Prelates of the Church, who therein take raoft pleafurc and felicitic. And 
there you haue my daughters bellowed among you. 

In the raigne of Henry the third, the Templars in London being in 
great glory, entertained the Nobilitib, forraine Embafladours, and the 
Prince himfclfe very often,infomuch that Matthew Paris of Saint 
Albans y who liued in thofe dayes, cried outypon them fortheir pride, who 
being at the firft fo poorc as they had but one hprfe to ferue two of them 
(in token whereof they gaue in tfepir fealcs two men vponone horfebacke) 
yet fuddenly they waxed fo infolcnt, that they difdained other orders, and 
forted thcmfelues with Noblemen. But this their infulting pride had a 
quicke period: for ftiortly after, to wit, in the beginning of King Edward 
thefeconds raigne, inthc Councell at Vienna,this their fo highly cfleemed 
order, was, vpon clearc proofe oftH'eir general!, odious, abbominable fins, 
and incredible Atheifticall impieties by them pradifed, vtterly abolilhed 
throughout all Chriftendome; And by the confent of all Chriftian Kings, 
depofed all in one day j taken all and committed to fafe cuftody: And thus 
being politikely apprehended, their lands and goods were feifed vpon: the 
heirSofthe Donours here in England, and fuch as had endowed thefe 
Templars withlands,cntrcd vpon thofe parts of their ancient patrimonies 
after this diflblution, and detained them vntill not long after they were by 
Parliament wholly transferred vnto the Knights of the Rhodes, orof S.

In the raigne dlEdward the third, the Glergic of England exceeded all

as would fuSice to finde and (uftaine one hundred and fifty Earles, onf 
thoufand andfiuc hundred Knights, fixe thoufand and two hundred EC 
quiers, and one hundred Horpitals, more then now be. 

But this Petition offpoiling the Church of England of her goodly patri- 
monies, which the piecie and wi/cdome of fo many former ages had con- 
gefted, was by the King (who was bound by oath and realon to prcleruc 
the flourifhing^ftate of the Church) fo much detefted, that for this their 
propolition, he denied all ocher their requefts: and commanded them that 
from thenceforth they fhould not prefumetointcrmcddle with any fuch 
matter. 

This King, as alfo his Tonne,and grandchilde, were wondrous indulgent 
to the Clcrgiej although they were daily difquieted with the bellowing of 
the Popes Prouiforic Bulls. For Her^ry the fitch was fbdeucuc and feruke 
able to the Church of Rome and her Chaplaines, that tic was called of ma 
nyjthe Prince of Priefts. And Henrj the fixth, fiirnamed the holy, wa^ an 
obedient childc, and no lefTe, nay more obfequious to the See Apoftolicall, 
then any of his predcceffours, howfoeuer 1 finde that once he rtieded the 
Popes Bull, concerning the reftoringof the Temporalities of theBilhop’ 
pricke of Ely. 

And now giue me leauc a little to digrcfTe, (peaking fomewhat by the 
way of the denomination of this word why the BifliopsofRome 

call their leaden Scales, by which they confirme their writings, Bulls. This 
word BuUa was called ibA id efi.,a of councell. For 

that anciently a golden Bull,broach, or ornament, ronnd and hollow with¬ 
in, was vfually faftened about the necks or breafts of young children, and 
femblablie to all their pictures, fignifying thereby, that their tender vn- 
bridlcd age ought to be gouerned by the grauc councell, and good aduife 
of others, of more maturitie inyearcs. And from hence the Bifhops of 
Rome borrowed the name for their leaden Seales; vpon one part of which 
the name of the Pope is to be read: on the other, the head of Saint Paul on 
the right fide of the CrofTcjand of Saint Pear on the left are to bee feene. 
Honoris tamen non praUtionis gratia faHitatum hoo ab Bcclefia. Nam 
quanquam S.Pttrm fit Princeps k^^pojlolici ordinis^tamen Ecckfia votuit 
eos indifereta ejjeexce^entU. But this was done of the Church (faith my 
Author) in regard of honour, not of preheminence; For jTlthough Saint 
Peter be the head of the Apoftolike Order, yet the Church will haue them 
to be of an vndiftindexcellence. 

Now the Popes per liuras fuoA luHatas Regi direBaSy^id preferre whom 
they pleafed, and how they picafed, to any Ecckfiafticall promotion here 
in England. One example for all. 

Innocent the feuenth by his Bull preferred Richard Fleming.^ firft to the 
Bifhopricke of Lincolne, then to the Archbifhoprickcof Yorke,and laft- 
ly driuehimbackeagaineby his roaring Bull to hisfirft preferment of Lin¬ 
colne. All which this King thus ratifies.

Such was the abfolute authority of the Pope 5 whofe name ('faith a 
namcleile Author) wasneuer Peter, except you grant Saint Peter to bee 
one and the fir ft, ('howfbeuer many of them haue had that namegiuen vn, 
to them in baptifme) the rcafon whereof is thus deliucred;

Now let me rcturne, this Digreftion being much longer tlien I exped- 
ed, asalfothis Chapter, which I will conclude as briefly as I mayj in the 
meane while take this (hort ftory, which I findc in the fourth part of Sir 
Edward Cokes reports, c^, de Scandalis, 

The Abbot of S. Athens commanded his feruant to go into the Towne, 
or fome place nearc adioyning, and to defirc a certaine mans wife to come 
vnto him, with whom (he (aid) he had an carneft defire to talke .• The fer- 
uant obeyed, and (like a good truftie Rogerj performed his Mafters com- 
m^ndementjin bringing the woman to his priuate chamber. Now fb fbonc 
as the Abbot and the wife were together, the feruant (well knowing his 
mafters rainde) withdrew himfclfe out of the way; and left them together 
alone in the chamber. The Abbot then began to accoaft the wife 5 celling 
her firft, that her array was meane, poore, and grolfe array ^ to which (he 
anfwercd, That her array was according to her fmal! abilitie, and the abi- 
licicofher husbandr The Abbot (knowing in what moft of w^omen rake 
thegreateft delight) told her that if (he would be ruled by him, (lie fliould 
haue as good array to weare, as the beft woman in the Parifti where fhee 
dwelt;and fo beganto^follicite her chafticic. The woman giuing no earc to 
his libidinous motions, the Abbot aflaulced her with ftruglingsand baudy 
embracings, thinking to get that by force which hce could not obtaine by 
faire meancs.But fheftill refifted all his encounters, pfomifes, and perfwa- 
fions, by which he detained her in his chamber a longtime again ft her will. 
The husband hauing notice of this abufe offered to his wife; began to talke 
of the matter,and faid that he would haue an Aftion offalfcimprifonmcnt 
againft the Abbot, for detaining his wife againft her will fb long in his 
chamber. The Abbot hearing of this (adding one finne to another) did 
fuethcinnocer^t poore husband in thcEcclefiafticall Court vpon an Adion 
of defamation, bccaufc f forfboth) the husband had giuen out,and publifh- 
cd abroad, that my Lord Abbot would haue made his wife a diflaoneft wo • 
man. The matter being opened in the Court, the husband had a prohi¬ 
bition, 6tc. 

This cunning finne (amongft other their crimes) .was vfually put in 
pratftife by the Church-men of other countries; witnefie Francis Petrarch 
Archdeacon of Parma in Italy, in one of his Epiftlcs, fme tituio, to his 
namelcflc friend; wherein heanatomifes the Romanc Clergie. Thus tranf- 
latcd.

had beenc made of him to the Court of Rome: or elfc pricked for ward by 
fomeofhis CounfelIours, to follow the example of the Germancs \ caufed 
Proclamation to be made on the eighteenth day of September, ng. 

x%. forbidding all his fubiejfts to purchafe or attempt to purchafe any man-

tion,and imprifonmentj and further puniflbmentof their bodies, for their 
fo doing,at his Graces plearurc,to the dreadfull example of aH other. 

Not long after, it was enacted, that appcalcs,fiich as bad been vied to be 
purfued to the See of Rome,{hould not be from thenceforth, bad, neither 
vfed but within this Realme^and that eueric perfon offendmg again ft this

the Prouifion and Preraunire, made in the fiue and twentieth yeare of the 
raigne of King Edward the third j and in the fixteenth yeare of King 
chard thefecond. 

And ftiortly after this, it being thought by the ignorant vulgar people^ 
that to fpeakc againft any of the lawes, decrees, ordinances, and conftitu- 
tions of the Popes, made for the aduancement of thdr worldly glorie and 
ambition, was damnable herefie; it was enabled that n© manner of fpeak-

the Pope, or his pretenfed authoriiie or power, madeor giuen by humane 
lawes or policies, and not by holy Scripture; nor any fpeaking, doings

made by authoritie of the See of Rome, by the police of men, which were 
repugnant and contrariant to the Lawes and Statutes of this Realme,' or

It was alfb enabled that no manner of appeales,ftiould be had,prouokcd,

of Biftiops within this Realmc. 

Another A(ft was made concerning the exoneration of the Kings Sub

sm. AwtiU It was aflSrmed in this Parliament,that there had been paicd to the Pope 
ofRomeonely for Bulls, by our Englilh Bilhops, and other of the king- 
dome, fince the fourth of Henry the feuenth to that time, threcfcore ihou- 
fand pound ftcrling. 

The next yeare following, in a Parliament begun at Weftminfler, the 
third of Nouember, the Pope with all his authoritie was clcane baniftied 
this Rcalmc,and order taken that he Ihould no more bee called Pope, but 
Biftiop of Romej and the King to be taken and reputed as fupreme head in 
earth of the Church of England, called AngUcam Eedejia. And that hee 
their Soucraigne Lord, his heires and fucceffours kings of this Realrae, 
fhould haue foil power and authoritie, from time to time, to vifit, reprefle, 
redrefle, reforme, order, correct, reftraine, and amend all foch errours, he- 
rcfics,abufcs,offences, contempts, and enormities whatfoeu^r they were, 
which by any manner fpirituall authoritie or iurifdi^Eon, ought or might 
lawfully bee reformed, repreffed, ordered, redrefled, corre^fled, reftrained, 
or amended, moft to the pleafure|of Almighty God, the increafe of vertue 
in Chrifts religion, and for the co’nftruation of peace, vnitie, and tranqui- 
litieof this Realmc, any vfage, cu%me, forraine lawes,forraine authority, 
prefeription, or any thing, or things, to the contrary thereof notwith- 
fianding. 

In this Parliament alfo were granted to the King and his heires,the firft- 
fruits and tenths of all fpirituall dignities and promotions. 

His ftile of fuprcmacie was further ratified, and declared to bee fet 
downe in this forme and manner following: in the Latine tongue by thefe 
words.

Which ftile was enacted, to bee vnited and annexed for cucr to the im- 
pcriall Crowne of this his Highnefle Realme of England. 

Vpon the firft expulfion of the Popes authoritie, and King Henries vn- 
dertakingoftheSupremacies the Priefts both religious andfccular, did, 
openly in their Pulpits, fo farrecxtoll the Popes iurifdi^Iion and authority, 
that they preferred his lawes before the kings; yea and before the holy pre¬ 
cepts of God Almighty. Whereupon the King lent his mandatory letters 
to cettaine of his Nobilitic, and others in cfpeciall office, thinking thereby 
toreftraine their feditious falfe do^inc and cxorbitancie; And here let me 
tell you that amongft many letters of important affaires, which I found in

by the decrees of the fame only,and by none other, they being conlbnant to 

the law of Chrifte. . „ t.

can prevayle to attainc right thone againft thothcr, that is to fay, in cawfes

werker of the fame. 

Forthcly, that our fayd Pryncc and Soucraigne, accordyng to the liber- 
tie and lawcs of Nature, and conftitucions of general I Counkulls (as afore ) 
hath both prouoked and appeledfrom the moft iniuft and vnlawfiill fen-

rail Counfaill next enfying, and lawfully Congregate, that is to fay, from 
the fcntence of the vfurper of Goddes lawes, and infringer of generall 
Counfells, which callyth himfelfe Pope. In the which our fayd Prynccs 
doyings, all iuft and true Chriftien men, fpecyally his moft louyng Sub-

andappellacionsalfb ftandyng in force, and beyng intimate to the perfon

Wherfore whatccnfurcs,interdidions,or other his curled invencionsfo

foW, Robin Hoods peniworths,amounted to more then one hundred thou- 
fund pounds, the religious perfons that were put out of the fame houfes, 
were in number abouc ten thoufand. 

It was a pitifull thing to herethe lamentation that the people in the 
countrey made for them/or there was great hofpitalitie kept among them, 
and as it was thought more then ten thoufand perfons, mafters, and fer* 
uants, had loft their liuings, by the putting downe of thofc houfes at that 
time. 

Before the diftblution of thefe religions houfes, the plot was laid for the 
fuppreffion of the reft. For firft of all, for an introdudion to that which fol¬ 
lowed, Cromwell and the reft ofthe Vifiters, in their vifications, put forth 
of their Couents all religious perfons, thatdefired to be eafed of the bur- 
denous yoke of their profeflion,to whom the Abbot or Prior was togiue 
to fuch fo departed for their habit, a Prieftsgowne, and fourty fhillings of 
money. The Nunnes to hauc fuch apparell as fecular women wore, and 
togo whither they would. .They put forth likewifeall religious perfons 
that were vndcr the age of fourc and twenty ycares, and afterwards clofed 
vp the refidue that would remaine, fo,that they could not come out of their 
places^ and tooke order that no man fhould come to the houfes of woipen, 
nor women to the houfes of men, but onely to heare their fei uice in the 
Church. This little bondage, after lb long and fo licentious a rime of liber- 
tic, could not be endured \ which being perceiued by the Commiffioners, 
with faire promifes of other preferments, or competent yearely penfions, 
they fo wrought v/ith the Abbots, Priors,and Priorcfres,and the reft of the 
GoucntSjthatdiuers of them furrendred vp their houfes with the appur¬ 
tenances into the Kings hands, before the fitting of this Parliament, as by 
thefe words in the forefaid Ad doth plainly appeare. 

And alfb be it cnaded,chat his Highnes (hall haue to him and his heires 
all and lingular fuch Monafteries, Abbics,and Priories, which at any time 
within on yearc next before the making gf this Ad, hath beene giuen and 
granted, by any Abbot, Prior, Abbeffc, or Priorefle, vndcr their Couent

gular the lands, tenements, goods, &amp;c.intcrcfts and hereditaments, &amp;c. to 
the fame appertaining and belonging. 

Now ('by the example of thefe, or by what other meanes I know not) 
the reft of the Abbots, Priors. AbbefTeSjand PriorefTes,at other times, with j 
vnanimousconfent of their Couents, in great compundion of fpirit, con¬ 
trition of heart, and confeffton of their manifold enormities, did fcuerally 
giue and grant to the Kings Maicftie, and to his heires, all their right and

their owne coffers, defpoikd her ot her vnualuable wealth and ornaments, 
and battered downe to the ground her facred Edifice. 

The fifth of December in the forefaid yeare, the Abbey of Saint

Now all, or theraoft ofall, the religious houfes in England and Wales, 
being thus fiirrendred, the King fummoned another Parliament at Weft-

gious houfes, with their lands, and all other the appurtenances to the fame 
belonging; vnto the King his hcircs and fucceft'ors for euer. Yet it was 
thought ncccffarie by the King and bis Counccll,that tbefe their voluntarie 
donations ftiould bee further ratified byauthoritie of that high Court; 
whereupon it was enabled; that all Monaftcrics, with their Scires,circuits,

which were (urrendred or diffolued, before the fclfion of this Parliament, 
but alfo facb as were to bee furrendred or diffolued hereafter, ftiould bee 
I vefted, deemed, and adiudged to be in the very affuali and reall feafoiijand 
' poffcffion of the King his heires and fucceffors for euer. 

The religious Order of Saint Johns of Icrufalem, whole chiefe manfion 
houfewas in the precinftsof Clerkenwell Parifh, within the County of 
Middlcfex, confifting of gentlemen and fouldicrs, of ancient families and

the King: And all thefe Monuments ('aforefaid) of our forefathers pietie 
and dcuotion, to the honour of God,the propagation of Chridian faith and 
good learning,and alfb for the relicfc and maintenance ofthe poore and im¬ 
potent (if without offence I may fpeake the truth.) All thefe, I fay, for the 
moft part, were fhortly afeer^to wit, within the remainder of his raj^nc, 
and the fliort time of his Sonnes, King Edwird the fixth: euery where pul- i 
led downc,their reuenucs fold and made away: and thofe goods and riches 
which the Chriftian pietie of our Englifli Nation had confecrated vnto 
God, fince they firft profefTed Chriftianity, were in a rr omtnc, as it were, 
difperfed, and (to the difplcafurc of no man be it fpoken) profaned. 

Thus haueyou feene, by degrees,the facall and final! period of Abbeyes, 
Priories, and fuchlike religious Strufturesj with the calling out to the 
wide world of all their religious Votaries; chiefly ocenfioned by their 
owne abhominable crying finnes, more then by any other fccondaric 
meanesjas plainly doth appeare by the premiffes All which Queene M-ny 
attempted to hauc reftored to their priflineeftate, and former glory. Bur 
all in vaine; for thefe religious Edifices with the lands and poficfflons 
thereunto belonging, were fo infringcd,alienated and transferred, that nei¬ 
ther the power of Maicftic, nor the force of Parliament, could reduce them 
againe to the proper vfe, for which by the Founders they were intended. 

Howfoeuer flie (being a Prince more zealous then polieike) rcfigntdj 
and confirmed by Parliament, to God and holy Church, all thofe Ecclefi- 
afticall reuenues, which by the authoritie of that high Court, in the time 
of her father King Henry bfpene annexed to the Crowne, to the great 
diminution and impoueriOaing of the fame. And this (lie did frankly and 
freely, moued thereunto by her owne confciencc, faying (with a ChriOian 
and princely refolution I muft confeffo) to certaine of her Counferoure, 
thatalbeitthey mightobie« 5 fagainft her, that the flatc of her kingdomc, 
the dignitiethereof, and her Crowne imperiall, could not bee honourably 
maintained and furnilhcd, without the pofTcffions aforefaid; yet foe fot 
more by the faluation of her foulc, then foe did by ten kingdomc?. 

And whereas in the raigne of King the fixth, it was enaefed, 

that all thebookes, called Antiphoners^ Mijjkles^GrailtSy Por^u/iffis^and 
Latine Primmers, vfed for feruicein the Church, in the time of Poperic, 
foould be clearely abolifoed; All images grauen, painted, or earned, taken 
out of any Church or Chappell, with the forefaid bookes, foould bee de¬ 
faced or openly burned. She being now more forward then wife toobferue 
the rites and ceremonies of the Romanifts,caufed the like bookes and ima- 
ges to be bought, and brought againe into all the Churches within her do¬ 
minions. Holy water,Pax, and cenfers were commanded to be employed 
at the celebration of MaGfes, and Mattens, Oylc, Crcamc,and Spittle, vfed 
in the Adminiftracion ofthe Sacrament of Baptifme. Altars furnifoed with

Chap. XVI. 

The time of theinUitution of^ligiom Orders. Their fueraU 
names and Authours^ and the infinite encreaje of their 
Fraternities and Siflerhoods* 

T Hc Popes ofRome challenging a fucc^ffion from Saint Pcrffr,and feek- 
ing to imitate the Hebrewes, began to inftitute Gftiaries, Acolites, Ex- 
orcifts, Readers, Snbdeacons, and Deacons. 

TheOffice of the Oftiarie was toopen and fhut the Church doores, to 
lookc to the decent keeping of the Church,and the holy ornaments laid vp 
intheVeftric; which is now the charge of the Vergers (as I take it j inCa- 
thedrall Churches. 

Acolites, or Acoluthites, were to follow and fcTue the Bifliop or chiefe 
Prieft, to prouideand kindle the lights and lamps of the Churchjandtore- 
gifter the names of fuch as were catechized. 

Exorciftshadthe power giuen them toexpcll vneleanc fpirits • and by 
fafting and prayer,to free fuch perfons as were fo pofTclE 

Readers, quos Pajisres a pafc0 nominatos putat matutmo

leBionibm quafi pafeebant. Which Saint Amhrofe fuppofeth to be called 
Paftours, by the Apoftle P&lt;iul: did reade the writings of the Prophets and 
Apoftlcs, at the time of morning prayer, and did feede, as it were,the pco- 
pie with fuch diuinc lelTons. 

The office of the Subdcacons was to fet^and giue out the Pfalmcs in fo- 
lemne tunes, to receiue the oblations of the faithfull, to write the Hues and 
Agons of the Martyrs,^and to declare, or make more plainc vnto the pco- 
pie the Epiftlcs ofthe Apoftles. 

Deacons had the charge to rclceue widowes and orphans, and other 
poore faith full people^ and to diftribute vnto them the almcs which deueut 
Chriftians had giuen to that intent. They were alfo allowed to preach the 
Gofpell, to interprete the Scriptures, and appointed to adornc the facred 
Altars,and belpe the Prieft in diuine Scruicc {a place officiated now by our 
Parifti Clerkcs) theft were choftn to bee men full of religion, integritie of

oiaS Saint Auguflii^e the chiefe Author of this inftittition,. who when lice 
had gathered together a companie of godly men, who liucd religioufly, 
farre from the noife and trouble ofthe multitude, being made a Bithop, he 

built a xMonaftehe for Glerkcs and Pricfts within his pallace, with whom 

he might Hue in common. Omfrim Paftmam writes, that Pope the 

firft, about the yeare 49 3 . placed the regular Chanons of Saint Attgnftine afr 
Latran in Rome ; Pope in the yeare i2pS- placed there Chanons

polTeft them, and reftored the regular. They were wont tofleepc vpon 
mattrcffes, and had blankets of wooll, they faded much, vfed great filcnce, 
and liucd in common, hauing nothing proper to chemfelucs : they vfed ex. 
erciles two hourcs in the day, and at the end of the yeare they made their 
proccffion.They did not admit any one to the habit vntill Iiec were feuen- 
tceneyearcs old ; and they gauc themfcluc’s tO ftudic and reaching. The 
rule ofthefc Chanons (confirmed by many Popes) edfififted chiefiy vpon 
three points, to haue nothing of their owne, to bccchafte,andtokeepe 
their cloifters. Which rule is deciphered in the old cloiftcr of the Mona- 
fteric of Saint John Latcran, in riming verfes, nowihardly to be read, thus.

drew them into Coenobies or Coiaents: and inftituted a difcip)ine,by the

at this day in Italy, cfpccially in the dominions of Venice, although all the 
Monaftcries there which arc of this order,doe acknowledge the Abbey of 
Grottaferata, tweluc miles diftant from Rome for their mother. 1 doe not 
finde that any of this rule liucd cucr here in England: which makes me be- 
Iceuc that this was noneof the foure Orders before fpecihed. 

The next Monafticke Order confirmed by the Church of Rome, was 
that of the Dodorof all Dodors, namely, SziniA(ig»f^we ; He was borne 
in the Gaftle ofTegaft in Carthage, about theyearc of our redemption 558. 
his Fathers name was Patricms,\{\% MoihttsMemcay by whofcincreaties, 
mingled with teares, and the learned Sermons of Saint Amhref^, bee was 
drawne from the errours of the Manachies; from Saint Ambrofi as then 
Bifliopof Millanin Italie, he returned into his owne countrey, where hce 
obteyned of the Bilhop of Hippo (whereof he was afterwards Biflbop him' 
fclfe) a garden without the Towne, caufing a Monaftery to be built there, 
in which he lined of the labour of his hands in all integritie, according to 
the inftitution of the Primitiue Church, He died of a feucr at Hippo, when 
he had fitten fourty ycarcs in his Biftiopricke, being feuenty and fix yearcs 
of age, on the fifth of the Kalends of September, leaning to poftcritie, two 
hundred and thirty bookes of his owne writing. This order multiplied 
greatly throughout the whole Chriftian world, howfoeuer branched into 
many feuerallordcrs,diffcringboth in habit and cxerciles, as alfo in rule 
and precepts of life.

The Friers Minors (faith Stow) firft arriued in England at Douer, nine

All things degenerate in time, and ftray in a manner from the right ciunbcke 
courle; for example, the order of Saint Benet which had flouriQied a long Monkes. 
fpace with great reputation of hoIineiTe, differed fo much from the fir ft in- 
ftitution of their Founder, that neither the decrees and authoriticof holy 
Fathers, generall and proninciall Councels could reforme or draw them to 
their firft principles, vntill the fanffine of one Odoyov Otboyhbhot of Clu- 
niin Burgundy, and one of Saintorder, reuiuedin a manner from 
death to life this Monafticall profefflon, forcing them to obferue, and ob- 
feruing himfelfe from point to point all that was pradifed in the time of S. 

Benediid. Soas many of their Abbots which were dravvnc by his good cx. 
ample, reformedalfo their Abbcycs,notonely in France, but as well in 
Spaine,Germany,Italy,and England; and for chat this reformation had 
his firft beginning at Cluni; the vnion of fo many Abbeyes was called the 
congregation of Gluni, and euery ycarc, by the Popes per mi ffion and au- 
thoritie,all the Abbots of this congregation met acaccrtainc place, and 
they called it the generall Chapter, whereas they treated of the order and 
life of Monkes, putting out, and punifhing fuch as had offended. This Odo 
liued inthcycareofourLord,pi3. 

It was no long time after, ere that thefe Benedictines fell againe to their ciftcrdan 
old vomit, their great wealth hauing made them, proud, idle, luxurious,! Monkes. 
carcleffe of Gods houfc 5 and in moft oral! of their aCtions, extreamely vi¬ 
cious. Whereupon one Robert Abbot ofMolefmea Towne in Burgundy, 
perceiuingthat the BenediCtinesMonkes of his owne houfe (as ofall orher 
Monaftericsj hadalmoft quite leftand forfiikcn the ancient rule and difei-

to Langres, in the faid Duchie of Burgundy, where hee ereCled a new Ab¬ 
bey for his new companions, whom hcc called Ciftercians, of the place 
where the Abbey v/as feituated. 

The liberties, immunities, and priuiledges of this Order was generally

The firft inftitution of this order was about the ycare 1120. their firft 
houfe here in England was at Newhoufe in Lincolnfhire. 

Thefe Votaries pretend to haue had their firft inftitution at mount Car- 
m d in Syria, where Elias and other heretofore liued fblirarily, and that the 
place being inhabited by many Hermircs ^ Kyilmerkke Bifhop of Antioch 
drew them together, liuing dirperfed about the mountaine, and buiT for 
them a Monafteric in that mount neare vnto a fountainc. They % a!fo that

confirmed by Pope Honorius the third. They afiiime tbae the Virgine

fcating thcmfclucs at Newenden in Kent, of which hereafter, was about 
the midftoftheraigne of King the third. Thefe, like as other Or¬

holy Crofle 


Trinitarian 

Friers.

Flier John. 


holdthztCletffiy Peters (\\lc\pkcind Bifliop of Rome, was the firft 
founder of this order. It is recciued for more truth, that one Cymeus Pa¬ 
triarch of leruftlent fwho &amp;ewcd S. Helen (the mother of Great ConfiAn 
tim) where the CrofTe was whereon our blefled Sauiour was crucified) was 
the firfl: that inftituted this Order, in memoriall of the inucntion of the 
CrolTei and gaue order that thefe Friers fnould euer afterwards came a 
CrofTe in their hands; but by reafon of Cyrium his martyrdome, vndtr 
the Apoftata lulian^ and the crucll pcrfecutions ot the Ghnihans, this or 
der became almoftquite cxtinguiihed, vntill Pope Imment the third gauc 
it new life: fince which time it hath cuer flouriQicd here and peyond Sea^ 
with fomc little reformation like the reft of itsfcliowes. This holy order 
came into England in the ycareof our faluation, i244-»heir hrft Cloiftci 
was at Colchefter, their greateft Monafterie was neare vnto the Tower, hil 
London, as yet called bythename of Cruched Friers. They did not of 
lateasatthefirftinftitution,carrythcCrofrein their hands, but ware a 
croffc of red cloth or skarlet fixed to their habit on their breaft. 

About the yeare 13 5 y.the order of the Trinitarian Friers came into Eng- 
landman order whofechiefc charge was to go and gather money to re- 
deerae Chriftians that were captiues vndcr the tyranny of the Turkes and 
Infidels; whereupon they were called Monachi de Redempttone captho 
rum, Monkes of the redemption of captiues. This order was inftituted by 
a Frier, called lohn MAtta,md Felix i^nachorita, who liueda folit-irie 
life in France, and were warned in their flccpeC as the tale goes) to repaire 
to Rome to the Pope, and to feeke for a place of him, to build theni a doi- 
ftcr. Which they did, and their petition being to them granted, they laid 
the foundation of the Monafterie now called Saint ot the Mount, 

in mount Celia Rome 5 wherein Frier died, and was buried , 

pearcs by an Arch or ancient Sepulchre of marble in the little Church of 

the Paid Church, on the which this Epitaph or Infcripiion is engrauen.

other Brethren of that houfc,for threcfcore Markes offiluer, which they 
had rccciued of the laid Prior and Brethren of Repentance, toward the 
building of the faid Bridge. 

This Order of Friers gathered many good Schollcrs, and multiplied in 
number exceedingly ,vntill by a general! Counccll it was decrecd,that there 
(hould no more Orders of begging Friers be permitted,but onely the foure 
Orders,and fo from that timethefe Friers decreafed and fell t© nothing. 
There were alfo Nunnes of this order, which were called Sachettes, whe¬ 
ther they had any Gouent in England or not, I do not know. But great S. 
Lewis King of France, being ftirrcdvp by C^^ncBlaunch his mother, in 
the yeare of our faluation, . hautng giuen vnto the Brethren of the 
Sacke,orof the repentancjcof Icfus Cbrift,a certaine houfe vpon theriuer 
of Seine, a little beneath S. Michaels bridge, in the PariQi ofSaint Andrew

to the Nunnes of the fame order, another houfeto inhabice in the (aid Pa- 
riQi, where neither of the orders made there any long abode .• but were ex¬ 
pelled in the time of the faid King, leauing onely the name of Sachettes vn¬ 
to the ftrectc. 

About the yeare 1048. (the Sarazins being matters of lerufalcm, and of 
the holy Temple which they ruined) certaine gentlemen and Italian Mer¬ 
chants vfed to frequent the ports and maritime towns of Syria and .^gy pt, 
who (for that they brought mcrchandife which was plcafing vnto thofe 
countries j were well enter rained,not onely by thegouernour of theTowne, 
but by thcGalife of «^gypt. Thefe Chriftians going often to lerufalcm to 
vifit the holy places, and hauing no place of retreat within the citic, they 
obtained leaue to build a Church, a Pallace, with certaine Monattcries for 
the lodging of Pilgriroes. But in the end they caufed an Hofpitall to bee 
built for the receiuing of all forts of Pilgrimcs, both ficke, and whole, and 
in like manner a Church, which was dedicated to S. John Baptift. 

In the yeare 10^ 9. the citie of lerufalcm being recoucred againtt the im-

whercunco Engenius the third added a red croffe on the breaft.Thc charge

/infticute the like order (as aforefaid j of Monkes and Nunnes, which was 
confirmed by Qrcgme the cleuenth;in the firft yeare of his Popedome.Shc 
obtained of the find Pope, that the Monafieries of her faid order fliould bee 
common as well for men as women; yet there flbould bee fuch a feparation 
by walls, as the one ftiould haue nomcancj to come vnro the other, but 
vpon great neceffitic. She would alfo haue but one Church for both fexes, 
and that the Monkes as Minifters offiicrcd things fhould bee below, and 
the Nuiines aboue, to fay their feruicc and prayers; but the Lady Abbcfle 
Ihould haue power to command both.* yet men (liould haue charge of that 
which did belong to the Diuine Seruice, and to the ornaments of the 
Church, and that there fhould be one amongft them that (liould be called 
Prior, or ConfefTour. She alfb ordained, that they (hould h.3uc lands and 
poffeffions wheronto Hue,but thcfupcrintendance to prouidefor all things 
that fhould be needfull,for the one and the other, as well for vi(fi:ual}s, as 
apparcil, fhould belong vnto the Abbefle. That it fliould not bee lawfull 
for either men or women to go out of their Monafterie, without great ne- 
ceffitie, and then they fliould demand Icaue of the AbbcfTe. They held the 
rulcofS. Auguftine, with certaine Articles added by this famous Qi^cnc. 
Some are of opinion, that this forme of Religion was firft inuenced in 
Greece, but that the Fathers had ordained, that the men fhould reroaine 
feperated from the women, left they fliould giuc occafion of fcandall; 
wherefore Saint Brigide defiring to reuiuethis order,flic found meanes how 
without any fufpitionjthc Church and houfe fliould be common to both. 
She ordained that they fhould weare a ruftet habit, with a cloke of the fimc 
colour, with a red crofte vpoh their breafts. Shee would haue but fixtic 
Nunnes,andfiueand twencic Monkes in euery Monafterie; that is to fay, 
thirteene Priefts, according to the number of the thirteene Apoftlcs, com¬ 
prehending Saint Then foure Deacons; who might alfo be Priefts, 

and reprefented the fourc Dodorsofthe Church.’and eight Conucrts,who 

1 might alwayes be readic to labour for the affaires of the houfe; fo as the 
Friers and Nunnes all together, made the number of the thirrcenc Apo- 
ftlcs, and the feuentictwo Difciplesofour Sauiour: And to the end they 
might be diftinguifhed one from another, the Priefts carried a red Croffe 
vpon the left fide of their cloke, vnder which croffe they put a little 
peece of white cloth, as broad as a wafer, which they offered vp in reue- 
rence of the holy Sacrament. And the foure Deacons, for a difference from 
the Priefts, carried a round wreath of white cloth, which fignified (as they 
gauc out) the fapicnce of the foure Doctors, whom they reprefented, and 
vpon it they put fourc little peeces of red, made like vnto tongues, to flaeW 
that the holy Ghoft inflamed their tongues to deliuer the facred myfterics 
of Diuinity. The Conuerts wore a white croffe vpon their clokcs, to flacw 
the innocencic of their Hues, vpon which there were fiue pccces of red, in 
commemoration of the fiue wounds of our Sauiour. 

At the diffoiution there was a Gouent of this Order, at Sion in Midlc 
fexe; now a raanfion goodly faire houfe belonging to the right honourable 
the Earle of Northumberland.

There was another S. Brigid of Ireland, farre more ancient. 

It is faid that the image of our Sauiour (poke to this pious (Jiiccne of 
Sweden, as ftie was faying her orizons before the high Altar in the Church 
of Saint ?ml in VU ojlienfi Rome: as appeares by an infeription vpon a 
table hanging in the fame Church, which I faaue feene. 

As many orders, or ncare thereabouts, as were of Friers, fb many were 
ofNunnes here and beyond Seas, for men in the feruencie of deuoiion did 
nor precede the weaker fex of religious women. The ftiidcft Order of 
Nunnes is that ofS. CUre 5 A Lady who liued in the fame time, and was 
borne in the fame Towneof Affile with S,Fram$s ,SS^hdc\\ Towne to this 
day brags of the birth of two fiich worthic perfons. Thcfc Clares obferue 
theruleof their Patron S. Francis^ and weare the like habit in colour.Tbey 
areneuer rich, and therefore to this day wherefoeuer they doeinhabite, 
they are called the poore Glares. This Saint Clare was tac firft Nunne of 
SdimiFramisOxi^Vj and her Mother and Sifter vndertookc the fame 
vow.

ofthc order of S. ThisS. (faith her Legend) touching the ^ 

world was ofright worthy and honourablelinage: and,as touching the fpi- 
rit to the regard of the ftatcof vertucs,and holy manners towards God^ of 
right noble reputation. 

Hauingfpoken already offuch religious perfbns as I finde to haue liued 
here in England in Coenobies or Couents,at the time of the gcnerall diftb- 
lution: it remaines now, to fay fome what of Hermits and Anchorites,who 
had at that time their folitarie little cells or cabbins in diuers places of this 
kingdorae, which Carrie ftill the name of Hermitages, in and about the 
countrey,and Anchor*holds,in PariCbor Abbey Churches. They were 
called Hermites, or Eremites, for that they liued iolitarily in defarts and 
wildernefTes; and Anchorites bccaufe they liued alone without all compa¬ 
ny; immured betwixt two wails, in the our fide of fome Abbey, or Parifb- 
Church,in which, by their rule, they were to hue, die, and to bee buried. 
Whofe exercife was feruent prayer, handy labour, digging and filling vp 
againe their graucs, which were to be within their Igdgings. Of the begin, 
ning and firft Authors of the Hermites lifethcre is great qutftion, which I 
Icaue vnto the learned; and adhere to the common recciued opinion, which 
affirmes that the times of pcrfccution were the firft caufe of this kinde of 
life.For when as in the time of Becim and Valerunm, Emperours, about 
tw^o hundred fifcic and two ycares after Chrift, they prepared horrible tor¬ 
ments againft the Chriftians, many diftrufting the weaknefie oftheflefh, 
and fearing to denic the name of God by their intollerable pcrfccutions, 
thought it fitteft tofeeke their fafetie by flight: Wherefore many Icauing 
Townes, friends, and all their wealth, retired thcmfclucs into defarts, and 

held

held chemlelues in folitaric places and caues, where they built poore cot¬ 
tages. Yea many times they went wandring vp and downe in thicke 
woods left they ftiould bee taken. But when the furie of their tyranny 
ceafed, they returned not vnto the world, but lined voluntarily in defarts, 
Co being accuftomed todiuine contemplation,and a quiet kinde of life,they 
continued in the courfc vntill death. Among the firft which entred into this 
couric of life, was Paul of Thebes, who lined in a caue at the foote of a 
rocke; aboutthc yeare of our redemption, 2^0. Thefecond was Saint Ari. 
tom of iEgypt, who built himfclfe a cottage vpon the top of an high hill, 
where he died hauing lined one hundred and fine yeares, in the yeare 345. 
S. Hkrome of Stridone in Dalmatia, that learned and religious Dodor Jed 
the like life in the defarts of Syria, not farre from lerufalem In cjuo loco 
deferto fe ieiunijs macerabat^ flangebat^ orabatyfludebat, atque etkm com 
mentabatur. In which vninhabited place,he macerated,or made leanc, his 
bodie with fallings; he lamented and bewailed his finnes,be prayed,he ftu- 
died, and writcercaine Comments vpon thefacred Scriptures; Many ocher 
workes he writ before his death, which happened about the yeare of our 
Lord, 388» 

But tocome nearer home where the repute and godlineffe of thefe Hcr- 
mites or Anchorites (for both of them liuing from the companie and con- 
nerfation of men; were called fometimes by the name of Hcrmites,and fome 
other timeof Anchorites J was likewife had in venerable regard-for we rcadc 
that when fruen BritiCh Bilhops, with other learned men of the Moaafteric 
of Bangor, were to mecte Auflin the firft Archbifhop of Canterbury, con¬ 
cerning certainc points tending to the Catholicke vnitie and concord, they 
came firft (faith venerable Bede) toacertaine holy and wife man, which 
liued thereabout an Anchorites life, to aske his counfcll , whether they 
ought at Auflins preaching and exhortation, to leauc their traditions, or no: 
And we rcadc, in the faid Auchour, that Cuthbert Bifhop of Durham (en¬ 
forced thereto by the King) incrcafing in the merit of religious and holy 
deuotion, came alfo to the Tccrct filcnce of an Anchors life and contempla¬ 
tion; that by prayet he brought forth water out of a ftonie ground, 3 od al¬ 
fo receiued graitie by the labour of his o wnc hands,an d that out of all feafon 
of fo wing.

Here the more willingly (to vfe the words of the tranferiber of thefe 
I Pfalmes) I haue inferted thefe parcels of the Plalter, that by this occafion 
I my Reader might palliate bis tafte with an EfTay of our Anceftors old Eng- 
! lifh, as well in the curte compofition of their profe, as in the neatnefle of 
i their holy meeters, which howfoeucr abounding with libertic,and thecha^ 
rafter of their times,yet haue, I confcfre,my admiration. 

And (for a conclufion) wereade in Henry Archdeacon of Huntington 
that a certaine Anchorite, or quidam vir Deij as he calls him, prophefied 
in King Etheldreds dayes, that forfomuch as Englifhmen were giuen oucr 
to all drunkennefie, treafon, and carelefiiefle of Gods houfe, firft by Danes, 
then by Normans, and a thii d time by the Scots they fliould be ouercome. 
Of which I fpeake clfewhere. 

To this retyred holy Order aforefaid, women were admitted as we-l as 
men. For I reade in an old Lieger booke that one ifcld Hetcn widow (vn 
like in conuerfation to thefe Anchorites I haue fpoken of,or the AnchorefTes 
in the Primitiue times) made fute to King Henry the fixth, that fhec might 
be an Anchorcflcjor vowed reclufe,in that part of the Abbey of Whally, 
anciently ordained for that purpofe 5 which was granted and thus con¬

Bat this religious Votareflc tooke no great delight in her ftraight lodg¬ 
ing, as appeares by the ftory: for within a Ihort time after, ihe being deli- 
rous of more libertie, broke out of her cage (as other fiich like holy Sifters 
had done before her) and flew abroad in the open world. Whereupon the 
Abbot and Couentof the faid Monafterie, made this certificate following 
to the King. 

To the Kyng owr fouereigne Lord, &amp;c. 

Be hit remembryd that the plcafe and habitacion of the feyd ReeJufe is 
within place halowed, and ncre to the gate of the feyd Monaftre. And that 
the weemsn that haue been attendyng,and acquayntyd to the feyd Reclufc 
haue recorfe dailly into the feyd monaftre, for the Huere of brede, ale, Ky- 
chin,and other thyngs, for the fuftentacion of the feyd Reclufes,accordyng 
to the compofleion endentyd above reherfed. The whyebe h not accor¬ 
ding to be had within fuche rcligyous plafcs. And how that dy vers that 
been Ancoresand Reclufcs in the feyd plafe afore tyme contrary to theyr 
own oth and profeiTyon, haue brokyn owt of the feyd plafe wherin they 
wer reclufyd, and departyd therfrom wythowt eny reconfiiyaryon.And in 
efpecyal how that now ifild of Heton that was laft Rcclufed in the feyd 
plafe at denorainacion and preferment of owr fouereigne L. and Kyng that 
now is, is broken owt of the feyd plafe, and hath departyd therfrom con¬ 
trary to her own oth and profeffyon, not willyng nor entendyng to be re- 
ftorydageyn^ and fo liuyng at tier own liberte, and large by this two ycr 
and mor like as fche had neuer bin profeflyd .And that diuers ofthe wymen 
that haue been feruants tfaerand attendyngto the Reclufes afortym have 
been mifgouerned and gotten with’chyld wythinthc leyd plafe halowyd 
to the grete difplelaunce of hurt, and difclandcr of the Abbey aforefeyd, 
5 cc. Pieafe hit yowr highnes of yowr cfpecial grafe to grant to yowr ora¬ 
tors, the Abbat and, &amp;c. 

This AnchorelTe hauing taken vpon her foftrifl: a vow, and being thus 
loofeinherlifeandconuerfationjforac may very well imagine that Nuns, 
which had more libertie allowed them by their rules, were farre more li¬ 
centious ; and indeed the Author of Piers the Ploughman fpcakes fin the

gaue fomewhat or other vpon their firft admittance into any ofthefe Mo. 
nafterics .* of which I could giue many examples, but in place take one for 
all which I haue read in the Liegcr booke of Saint Maries the Nunnery 
at Clerkenwell. Where Sir William de San6io Georgio , or Saint George 
knight(one of the Anceftors of Sir Richard^ S, George Chrentieux now li- 
uijjg) glues to the Prioreffe and her Sifters of the forelaid Saint Maries Cler- 
ken well-with his daughter, vpon her admittance into their Nun¬ 

nery, halfe a Verge of land In Kingftone in Cambridgelhire. Teft. wiilelmo 
de Bam. Roberto de S. Georgio. Roberto de Hajjelhgtotifeldy ^c. a deed fans

And by anothcfdeed the faid Sir WiUiam Saint George giucs to the faid 
Priorie of Clerkenwell, for the (bules health of himfelfe, bis father, his mo¬ 
ther, and his wife; and with Albreda his lifter, who was to be a Niiime of 
the faid houfe, his land in Haflelingfeld, within the forefaid Coumie of 
Cambridge, which Robert Rufis held in f ratis in pafiuuy Teft, Euftac. 
de Bancis^Willelmo deBancit, Roberto deSanElo Georgia^ ^c. 

And many others having large portions in their ownepofleflions, outof 
zealcanddeuod6n, would giue all, with themfelues,to fome Cloifter or 
othcr,and therein take vpon them the habitc of Religion. As many Englifti 
doe in thele dayes vpon their admiflSon into religious Orders beyond 
Seas. 

They were wondroufly enriched by the burials of great perfonages, for 
in regard ofburiall, Abbeyes were raoft commonly preferred before other 
Churches whatlbeuer; and he that was buried therein in a Friers habite, if 
you will beleeue it,neuer came into hell 

Vpon their vifitihg and confeffing of the ficke, they euer vfed fome per- 
fwafiue argument or other, that it would pleafc the ficke perfon to beftow 
fomewhat more or lefTe (according to his other abilitie) towards the main^ 
tenance oftheir Fraternities, or the repairing of their Monafteries; and that 
he would bequeath his bodie to be interred in die Church oftheir Couent, 
with a promife that they would daily fay prayers and make iiiterceffion for 
his foule. They got likewife by confeffing fuchas were in perfed health, 
giuing them abfolution,and cnioyning them penance,according as they re- 
ceiued gratuities. O f all which, will it pleafe you reade thefc pafTages fol¬ 
lowing, copied out of the Author of Vkrs Rlowman^ and Geffrey Chaucer, 

And

Men mote giuc filuer to the poorc Frcercs. 

The Priefts likewife in generall as well of Cathcdrall, Parocbiall, as of 
thefe Gonuciituall Churches got much by faying of Maflfcs • as it is intima- 
ted to vs by the Plowman in thcic few lines following. 

If pryeftes were perfite they would no filuer take 
For Mafies, ne for Mattens, ne her meates of vfurers, 

Ne nether kirtlc ne cote though thei for cold (hold die. 

But that which brought moft riches to all the forefaid Churches, was 
the Shrines, Images; and Reliques, of this or that Saint, in this or that 
Church efpecially honoured and preferued^ to the Vifiters whereof (who 
with great coft and labour did vndertake fo holy and deuout relblution) 
great Indulgences and Pardons were granted by feuerall Popes (as will 
appeareby thefequele)and fofemblablic to their facred Altars and other 
holy places: and fuch like Indulgences and Pardons they were, as were 
anciently granted to the Churches in Rome; which will norfeeme imper¬ 
tinent (I hopcj hcrctofct downe,a 51 haue them out of an old booke in 
broken Englifti, which crept into the world in the minoritieof Printing, 
and is commonly called. The Cuftomes of London. But, before 1 go any 
further, let me tell you, that Reliques were cuer holden in moft rencrend 
regard, ainongft all forts of people, infomuch that in the taking of any fb- 
Icmnc oath, they vfed to lay their hand vpon certainc Rcliqucs,as they did 
vpon the holy Euangelifts; For I heard that King Henrie the fecond being 
to clearc himfclfc of Archbifhop Beckets death, at a generall aflcmblie hol¬ 
den within the Citie of Auranches, in the Church of the Apoftle Saint 
An drew i before the two Cardinals, T heodinm and Albert Popes Le¬ 

gates, and a great number of Bifhops, and other people, made his purga¬ 
tion in rcceiuing an oath vpon the holy reliques of the Saints; and vpon the 
facred Euangelifts, that he neither willed, nor commanded the laid Arch¬ 
bifhop to be murdered. 

The hook Pardon of^megroMnted by diuers Popes.

In the cite of Rome ben iiiichirches in which is MafTe daily don, but 
.thcr ben vii of the fame priuileged aboue all the ocher with gret holioes and 
Pardon, as is here aftir fhewid. 

The furft is called Saint Peters C birch th appoftell, and is fet vpon the 
fotofan hill, and men goo vpward thertooa fteycrofxxix fteppes high, 
and as oft as a man gooth vp and downc that ftey er, he is relefid of the fe- 
uenth part of penaunce inioyned and graunted by Pope Kyifinder, 

Item^ as yc come before the Chirch ther the well fporingethjfo may yc

Itewy in the fame Chirchc on the ryght fide is a pilour that was fome-

the Turkes, as he promifedj but conueied to Rome, and there laid vp in his 
owne Treafurie: whileft the enemies of the faith did greatly infeft the Chri* 
ftians. But this Pope of all other, in my iudgement, had the moft /hamefull 
and cunning (hifes to get money withall, and was more opprobrious in all 
his actions then any other either before or fince. But as he liued wickedly, 
fo heedied miferably,being poyfoned with the fame banc which hce had 
prepared for another. SAnnAz.&lt;irm^ and other writers of that age,

So that the finfull Father did the Daughters bed defile.

learned, and religious Biflaops as England,whofc fanditie did fo {hinc5that 
all which faw them and their good workcs,afluredly knew, that they were 
the feed, to whom God had imparted his blcffings: their conueiiation and 
ftudic being alwayes about heauenly matters. 

As the rod Aaron did bud and blolfome, and bring forth ripe Al¬ 
monds, fo the Church and Miniftery of England, by the meancs of our 
reuerend Bilhops, as of Gods facred inftruments, did (and ftill doth ) pro- 
fper, flourifti, and bring forth fruits ofrighteoufnenc^to the glorie of God, 
and comfort of all true Chriftian hearts. 

Now before I conclude this point,giuc me leaue to fpeakc a little further 
of the firftinftitutionofBilbops out of thebooke of anamelcfic Author, 
written in Latine about three hundred yeares finccitranflatcd into Englifh 
by one William Marjhall^^nd imprinted at London by one Jiolen 
Ann. I the 27. of King ffenrj the eighth, the booke is called, The 

Defence of Peace. 

After the tymes of the Apoftles, the nombre ofPreeftes beyng nota- 
blyc augmented,and increaled (faith he) toavoydefclaundre and occafyon 
of offendynge any man, and to avoyde feifme and dyvyfion, the Preeftes 
chofc one among themfclues, which fhuldc dy rc^fc and ordre the other, as 
touchyngeto the exereyfynge of thcEcclefiafticalloffyce,or lervice,and 
the dy ftry butyng of the oblacyons, and the dyfpoly nge and oidcryngc of 
other thyngs in the mbft conuenienc maner, leftc yf euery man myght do 
this thinge after his ownc pleafure,as he left hirafclfe, the good ordre and 
fervyce of the Churches myght be troubled, by the rcafon of the dyuerfe 
affeccionsof men. This Preeftc whiche was fo elected and chofen, to or¬ 
dre and rule the other Preeftes, by the cuftomc and vfed maner of fpea- 
kynge of them that came afterwards, was oncly called a Bysftiop or ouer- 
feer- bccaufe notonely he was ouerlokcr of the Chriften people,for whiche 
caufe all other Preefts alfo were called Ouerfeers in the Prymatyuc Church; 
but alfobecaufe he had the ouerfyghtof the other Preeftes. Howfoeuci, 
faith he, in the fame Chapter, in the effentyall and infeparablc audoryte 
anddygnyteof Preefthood 5 the Bysfhops have no preheminence aboue 
other Preeftes, but onely in autftory te accy dentall, being that the Bifhop by 
the provydence ofGod is chofen (vponthc former reafon) to have the rule 
and gouernment of the C lergic within his DiocefTe .* For in the power and 
audoryte of makyng and admynyftryngthc Sacraments, and performing 
of other duties belonginge mcercly to the Preefthood, all Preeftes (faith 
hej have all oneau£loryte in kyndc: ncyther the Bysfhop of Rome,or any 
other Bysfhop hath this audoryte any whyt more largely, than any other 
hath who eucr he be, bey nge called a fymple or pry vate Preeft. And ther- 
forc it is to be racrvayled, wherfore forae men do ftry ve ftyffely and fro- 
wardly affyrmynge yet no thynge rcafonably, that the Pope of Rome hath 
more large power of the keyes gcuen to hym of Chryfte than hath other 
Preeftcs,feing that this cannot be proued by the holy Scryptnre, but ra¬ 
ther the contrary. For whiche thyngs, to go on with my Author, more 
cuidcntly to be fcenc and perceyved, you ought to vnderftande and knowe,

Ghurch-doOre, to the Parfon or Vicars houfe, or into any part of his bafe 
or inner Court (prouided that the faid houfe and courts bee within confe-

rcade more at large in Camden his diuifion of Britaine, and know more by 
Sfeed in his Type of this flouriflaing kingdome. 

The Ecclefiafticali ftate of England is diuided into two Prouincesor 
Archbiftiopricks; of Canterbury, and of Yorke. The Archbifliop of

Euery DiocefTe is diuided into Archdeaconries, and the Archdeacon is 
called Oculut Epifeopi, The eye of the Bilhop. And euery Archdeaconrie 
is parted into Deanries, and Deanries againe into Pariflies, Townes, and 
Hamlets. 

The Bilhop is called the Ordinarie, in the Ecclefiafticali Law, ^ia

for chat he hath ordinarie iurifdidion in his ownc proper right.and not by

All the Archbilhops and Bilhops of England hauc bccnc founded by 
the Kings of Englandj and do bold of thc.J&lt;.ing by Baronie, and haue been 
all called by writ to the Court of Parliament, and are Lords of Parliament. 

And the BiChopricks in Wales,-were founded by the Princes of Wales; 
andthePrincipalitie of Wales was holden of the King of England, as of 
his Crowne. And the Bifbops of Wales are alfo called by Writ to Parlia¬ 
ment, and are Lords of Parliament as Biflbops of England be. 

There were within the Rcalme of England one hundred and eighttene 
Monaftcries, founded by the Kings of England, whereof fuch Abhors and 
Priors as were founded to hold of the King per Baroniamy'^nd were called 
to the Parliament by Writ, were Lords of Parliament, and had places and 
voices there. And of them were twenty fixe Abbots, and two Priors, as by 
the Rolles of Parliament appeare; yet if you reckon the Abbot of Feuer. 
(ham in Kent, founded by King Stephets y there were twenticand feucti, 
which Tome do, faith ray learned Author, warranted by thefc words in the 
Cartularie: Et dedit Ahbmy et C^tonachis. et fuccejfonbus j is Mxmrium

Henry the firft Duke of Lancaftcr, vnder Edward the third in the warres

This ArchbiOaop being recalled from exile, and reftored to his 
former honours and reuenewes, carried himfelfe more obftimitcly then be¬

The body of this murdered Biflaop was buried hrii in the vndercroft of 
the Church, but Qiortly after it was taken vp and kid in a moft fumptuqus 
Shrine in the Eaft ends at the charges of Langton his fucceflbur; 

being matriculated by the Pope a glorious Saint and Martyr. To this new 
ftirined Martyr, people of all degrees, and from all parts, flocked in pilgri¬ 
mage : as ChAttcer thus hath it in his Prologue to his Canterbury talcs. 

—^— -fro euery (hires end 

Of Englond, to Canterbury they wend: 

The holy blisfull Martir for to fcckc, 

That hem hath holpen wher they were fckc. 

They loaded the Shrine with fiich large offerings, that the Church did 
allround about abound with more then Princely riches, whofe meaneft 
part was pure gold,garniftied with many precious ftones. Whereof the 
Scefeft was a Regall of France, or a rich gemme, offered by K ing Lewis^ 
who asked, and obtained (you may be furc, he buying it fo dearej that no 
paffenger betwixt Doucr and Whitefand, (hould perilh by (hlpwracke. 
SuchpreflSng there was to touch him,and fuch creeping and kneeling to his 
Tombe, that the prints of their dcuotion in the marble ftones rcmainc to 
this day. Euery pillar refounding the miracles of this reputed M3rtyr,and 
the Church it Iclfe, dedicated to Chrift, forced to giuc place to the name of 
Saint Thomas, His bloud was as then almoft matched in vertue with our 
blelled Sauiours,and his old (hoe deuoutly kiflTed by all paflengers. The 
building of this fhrine is thus briefly deferibed by that painfull Antiquaric 
Io,Stdw, It was built (faith he) about a mans height all of ftonc, then vp. 
ward of Timber plainc, within the which was a cheft of iron, containing 
the bones of Thomas Beckett Skull, and all, with the wound of his death, 
and thcpeececutoutofhis skull laid in the fame wou^d. The timber 
worke of this Shrine on the out fide was couered with plates of gold, da¬ 
masked and cmboflTcd with wires of gold, garnilhed with broches, images, 
Angels, chaincs,precious ftones, and gseat orient pcarlcs, the fpoilc of 
which Shrine (in gold and iewels of an incftimable value) filled two great 
chefts, one of which, fixe or eight ftrong men could do no more then con- 
ucy out of the Church: all which was taken to the Kings vfcjand the bones 
of Saint Thomas (by commandement of the Lord Cromwell) were then 
and there burnt all to afties. Which was in September, the yeare 153S.

This Anthem was likewife made to his honour. 

Tu per Thome finguinem quern pro te impeniity 
Fac nos Chrifte/candere quo Thomas afeendit. 

For the bloud of Thomas which he for thee did fpend 
Grant vs Chrift to clime where Thomas did afeend. 

The Pope writ to the Glcrgie of England, to make a new Holiday for 
this late Martyr,anex;frad or claufc whereof followeih. 

Wee admonifla you all, and by the author! tic which wee reteync doe 

ftraightly charge you, that you celebrate the day of the fuffering of the 
blefled man the glorious Martyr, fometime Archbifhop of Can-' 

terbury, cuery ycare in moft folcmne fort, and that with deuout prayers ye 
cndcuouryourfelues topurchafcforgiuenefTcoffinncs; that he which for 
GhriftsfakcfuiFcrcdbanifliment in this life, and marty rdome in death by 
conftancic of verme, through continuall fuppllcation of faithfull people, 
may make interceffion for you to God. 

The tenor of thefe letters were fcarcely read, but euery man with a loud 
voice began to recite and fing, Te Deum laudamus. 

Furthermore, becaufc his Suffragans had not exhibited due rcuercnce to 
him their father, cither in time of his banifhment, or at his returne from 
the fame, but rather pcrfecuted him* that they might openly confeffe their 
errour and wickcdncfTc to all men, they made this Colledf. 

Be fauourabic good Lord to our fupplication and prayer, that we which a CoHeft ae 
acknowledge our fclues guilty of iniquitie, may be dcliucrcd by the inter- 
ceffion of Thomos thy blefled Martyr and Bifhop. Amen. 

This Colled was likewife vfed by the Couent of S. Albonsy and other

The firft Archbiftiap that I hndc to be buried in this Church was Cnth- 
hert^ or Cudbri^i (for before him they were alwaves buried at Saint 
guftines) anEngliihman of great parentage, tranflated from Hereford, the 
yeare 741. to this fcate of Canterbury. In whofe time the Laitie were wic¬ 
ked, arid the Clergie worfcj the whole land was ouerwhelmed with a moft 
darke and palpable mift of ignorance,and polluted with all kindeofim- 
pietie. Which to reformc, hee called together a Synode of Bilhops and 
learned men at Cloueflaoo (now Cliffe at Hoo)bcfidc Rochcfter,and there, 
after long confultation, caufed one and thirtic Canons to bee decreed, one 
of which was, That the Priefts were required to reade to their Pari Ihoners 
the Lords prayer, and the Creed in the Englifh tongue: which, with the 
reft, you may reade in WtllUm Malmesbury. This Biftiop obtained from 
the Popea difpenfation for making of Gcemiteries,or Churchyards,with¬ 
in Townes and Cities, whereas vndll his time within the walls none were 
buried 5 as I haueitthus in a Manufeript. Cutbertus Archkpifcopm Cant,

all by Francis Qodmn^no^ Biftiop of Hereford. Yet for method lake thus 
muchjbccaufc I find his body (by a Table inferibed which hangs vpon his 
Tombe) to be here interred. He was borne in Italy, at Pauia, fotnc twenty 
miles from Myllainc, brought vp in the Monafterie ofBecce in Norman, 
die, vndcr/fer/ewin the learned Abbot of that houfe, of which he became 
Prior: from whence, in regard of his finguiar wifedome, and great know¬ 
ledge in all good literature, he was called by wiUiam the Duke of Nor¬ 
mandie to be Abbot of S2!mi Stephens \n Canc,a Monaficrie that the laid 
Duke had founded. And in the fifth yearc after his conqiieft of England, he 
promoted him to this Archbilhopricke, which he laudablie gouerned the 
fpacc ofeighteenc yeares. It isfaid fanaiflion which muchobfeured all his 
former praifes) that he perfwaded the Gonquerour to leaue the kingdome 
of England to his younger Tonne william Rufus: which they laid William 
thus requited ;th€ Bilhop (as the King thought) being fomewbat too bu- 
fie in reprehending his manifold vices,and exhorting him to godlincflc and 
vertue. he fo bitrerly fell out with him, that he banilhed him the Rcalmc; 
the poorcold bilhop trauelled to Rome- and wandred vpand downe many 
countries, till by interceffion of friends hce was fuffered to rcturnc home-

Stratford vpon Avon; a man famous for his learning, and good gouern- 
ment of his iurifdidion. He was called from the Sec of Winchefier to this 
place; he was Lord Chancellour of England, and proredor of the Realmc, 
in the abfenceof Edvoardiht third in France; but ncuer man enioyed fuch 
great honours with lefle comfort. It is written that hce was confecrated 
vpon the Sonday, called then ^ MhUa tribnlationes iuftorumt which hce 
thought beaded or foretold vnto him, how in the whole courfe of his life, 
he (hould finde nothing but trouble 3 which fell out according to his omi- 
nous conceit. For neuer any Archbilhop, cither before or after him,giuing 
fo little caufej and doing his cndcuour to plcafc, was more cncombrcd with 
vndeferued and often crofics. The ftory is ouer-long here to relate, I muft 
referremy Reader to the Catalogue of BiQiops. Yet before his end (which 
happened Anno 1348. hauing bccne Archbifhop 15.yeares) he had made 
an end ofall his troublcfome crofles,and liued certaine yeares quietly-they 
writ of him that he was a very gentle and roercifull man, rather too remiffe 
then any way rigorous to offenders, and a pitifull man to the poore. He 
founded a Colledgeat Stratford vpon Avon,and endowed the fame largely. 


Here licth oblcurcly buried John Vfford^ brother to that illuftrious

hundred yearcs enioyed that place fo long. And to addc more honour to 
his Grace, and money to his purfe, he was about two yeares Lord Chan 
cclourofEngland,and Cardinall tt. S.CirUci inlhermis^ytx. all this time 
for all thefc great and eminent promotions, he left nothing behinde him to

thcYniuerfiticj BiUmgfmrth before him had put in one hundred pounds 
and nc (forfooth) imitating that munificent example, put in one hundred

pradifed as an Aduocate in the Arches, then hec was Parfon of Barley in

He was fent Embattadourby Henry the feuenth,to the Duke of Burgundy, 
concerning the two counterfeits, and Perkin Warbecki which the 

DuchelTc his wife had fet vpagainft him. In which bulineue heebchaued 
himfelfe fo wifely, as the King highly commended him, and preferred hina 
vpon his returnc, to the Bifliopricke of London; and vpon the death of 
Henry DeanCy to this of Canterbury. He was alfo made Lord Chanccllour 
ofEngland by the fame King- in which office he continued, vntill hee was 
wrung out by wol/ey^^t feuenth dt Henry the eight. The ceremony of his 
inthronization to Canterbury was performed in a raott magnificent man¬ 
ner : the Duke of Buckingham,and many other great men of the kingdomc 
being that day his officers. In his folemne and fumptuous feaft, all his ho¬

Auguft 1^. 153 2. after hee had continued ArchbiQiop eight and twentic 
yeares, and was buried without any great funerall pompc, mourning 
clothes being giuen onely to the poore. Hee purchafed much land for his

with fairc buildings, eucn to the value of thirtie thoufiind pounds, as hee 
profeflcthj for which caufe hee prayed his Succeflburs to forbeare fute for 
dilapidations. His motto I finde in many places of the pallace,which was,

Bsrnahie^^ he flayed at Aainion vntill the fcafl of S. Lawrencey{tom whence 
taking his iourney for England, he landed at Douer vpon S. Gregoties day. 
Now if any man of his coat, dignitie,and reuenue, be defirous to know the 
cxpenccs of a iourney to Amniony here he may haue it, taken out of the red 
booke of Canterbury, to a fingle halfc-pennie.

But to conclude with the words of a late writer. This Stephen was a 
man fo continually in motion (faith he) that we cannot take his dimenfion, 
butonelyin paffing, and that but on one fide which was warre: on the 
ocher, we neuer iW but a glaunceon him, which yet for themoft part, was 
fuch as (hewed him to be a very worthy Prince for the gouernment. Hee 
kept his word with the State, concerning the rclicuemcnt of Tributes, and 
neuer had Subfidy that we finde. 

But which is more remarkable, hauing his fword continually out,and fo 
many defedions, and rebellions againft him,hcc neuer put any great man 
to death. Befidcs it is noted, that notwithftanding all thefe mifcrics of war, 
there were more Abbeyes built in his raigne,then in an ioo.ycares before; 
which (hewes though the times were bad,they were not impious; the king 
hirofelfc being mentefiipmus^ as he was miles egregius. 

His body refted here in quietnelTe vntill the diffolution, when for the 
gaine of the lead wherein it wascncoffined,it was taken vpand throwne in¬ 
to the next water. So vneertaine is man, yea greateft Princes, of any reft in 
this world, euen after buriall. 

Here fometime likewife lay interred Mani his wife, the daughter of 
Earle ofBulloignc, the brother of Godfrey^ and Baldmn of Bul-

money : and thereupon (vngratefolly) vrgedthem for a great fumme to let

And two times Maire of that plas 

I paffyd to God the thirteenth ofluly, 

On thoufand fyve hnndryd and forty. 

The people of this place make a great vaunt of the heft wheate in all 
KentorChriftcndome. 


Now here (gentle Reader) giue me leaue to fpeake a little more of the 
Priory of Leedes, though cafually mifplaced, becaufe forgotten. 

Ifinde (faith Ltmburi) in a Heralds note (who belike made his con- 
icSuteby fome coate of Armes lately apparant) that one an 

Earle of Salisbury, was the founder oPthis Priory. And indeed it is to be 
feene m the Annalls of Saint Aug fines of Canterbury, that a Nobleman, 
called Roter Le^hurne,-eii6 fometime of great authoritic within this Shire, 
notwithftanding that, in his time he had tafted of both fortunes: for in the 
daves of king Bean the third, hee was firft one of that coniuration, which 
was called the Barons warre; from which faftion Edmrd the kings fonne 
' wonne him by faire meanes to his patt.and made him the ^arer of bis pri- 
uiepurfe. Afterward they agreed not vpon the reckoning, fo that the 
Prince (charging him with great arrerage of account) feifed his liuing tor 
faiisfaffion of the debt, by which occafion Rogen once more became of the 
B irons partie. But after the pacification made at Kenelworth, he was eft- 
loones rcceiued into fauour, and was made Warden of the fiue Ports, and 
Lieutenant of this whole Shire. Now though it cannot be true, that this 
man was the builder of this Priory (for the fame Annals fay, that it was 
crefted long before) yet if hee did but marry the heire, he might truly bee 
termed the Patton or Founder thereof: for by that name, not onely the 
builders themfelues, but their pofterityalfo (to whom the glory of their 
deeds did defeend) were wont to bee called Pattons and Fonndertas well 

** Ittfobferued, by my Author^n this place fpeaking ofthe Prioryj that 
inancient'time,the greateft Per&amp;nagesheldMonkes,Friers andNunn«,

I haue the rather inferted this Bull, for that it may bee the more plainly 
vnderftood; how the moft of all caufes in thofe times concerning the Clcr- 
gie, were arbitrated not alwaycs by the authority of the learned Bilhops 
of this land, but by CoramiflGons purchafed from the Bifliops of Rome. 

This Priory was valued in the Records of the late fuppreffion, at three 
hundred fourefcore and two pounds of ycarcly reuenue.

hitherto found any thing touching the % 1 igious Houfeof UHotindene in

that you might vnderftand, with what number of buildings, variety of

furniffied. No corner (almoftj without feme Religious houfe or other; 
Their feds and orders were hardly to be numbred; and as for their lands 
and reuenues, it was a world to behold them. I finde that the yearely ex¬ 
tent of the cleare value of the Religious liuings within this Shire,amounted 
to hue thoufand pounds; Bilhoprickes, Benefices, Friaries, Chauntcries, 
and Saints-offerings not accounted. Which thing alfo I do the rather note, 
to the end that you may fee, how iuft caufe is giuen vs, both to wonder at

Thomas Becket) faith, that Becket (being at the length reputed for the 
kings enemy) began to be fo commonly negleded, contemned, and hated, 
that when as it happened him vpon a time to come to Stroude,the inha¬ 
bitants thereabouts (being defirous to defpite that good Father) flicked 
not to cut the tailc from the horfe on which he roadc, binding themfelucs 
thereby with a perpetuall reproach: For afterwards (by the will of God) 
it fo happened, that eucry one which came of that kindred of men which 
had played that naughty pranke,were borne with tailes,cucn as brute

Let vs include this Bifhop in our owne Orbe, as it were the Pope or Fa-

Informer ages (faith Camden'm this tra£l:) during the Romanc Hierar¬ 
chic, the Archbifhops of Canterbury were Primates of all Britaine,Legates 
to the Pope, and as Vrhane the fecond faid,Thc Patriarkes, as it were, ofa^ 
nother world. 

And thus the Archbifhops of Canterbury, by the fauour which Attftin 
had with Gregory the Great, by the power of Lanfranke., and by the indu- 
ftrie of Anjelmcy were much exalted: but how' much that was to; the grie*-

Theobald the next Archbifliop of Canterbury.- But when he had rcceiucd 
repulfe in that fort offuite allb, and found no way left to make auenge- 
ment vpon his enemy,he returned home al] wrotb^and (as it wasfufpeftcd^ 

wreaked the anger vpon himfclfe. 

After this another burly burly hapned in a Synodc aflTembled at Weft- 
1 rainfter,in the time of King Henry the fecond,before Cardinall H»^&lt;&gt;(Pope 
Alexanders Legate) betweene Richard and Rogers thcn'Archbilhopsof 
thefc two Sees, vpon occafion,that Roger of Yorkc commingofpurpotc(as 
it{houldfceme)firft totheaflembly, had taken vp the place on the right 
hand of the Cardinall: Which when Richard of Canterbury had cfpied, 
hcerctufed to fitdowne in the fccond roome ; complaining greatly of this 
preiudicc done to his See. Whereupon after fundrie replyes offpeceb^ the 
weakerindifputation (after the manner of Schoole-boycs in the ftrectsj 
defeended from hotc words, to haftic blowes; in which encounter the 
Archbifhop of Canterbury (through the multitude of his attendants) ob¬ 
tained the better. So that he not oncly plucked the other out of his place, 
and all to rent his cafulc,Chimcr.and Rochet, but alfo difturbed the holy 
Synode therewithal!, in fuch wife, that the Cardinall, for fcare, betooke 
himtohisfcete,the company departed, their bufinefle vndone,and the 
Biftiopsthemfeluesraoued fuitc at Rome, for the finilhingof their con- 
troucrfic. By thefe, and fuch other fucceffes, on the one fide, the Biftiops 
of Canterbury following, tookefuch courage, that from thenceforth they 
would not permit the Bifliops of Yorkc to bearc vp^ibc Croffe, either in 
their prefence, or Prouincc. . , ^ ‘ . r 

And on the other fide, the Bifhops ofYorke concerned fuch griefeof 
heart, difdaine and offence, that from time to time they (pared no occafion 
to attempt both the one and theother. 

Whereupon,in the time of a Parliament holden at London,in theraigne 
of Kino Henry the third, Boniface^ Archbifliop of Canterbury, incerdifted 
the Lo^diners, becaufe they had fuffered the Bifliop of Yorke to bcare vp 
his Croffe whiles he was in the Citie. And much adoe there was ( with¬ 
in a few yeares after) betweene Robert Kilwarby of Canterby, and ivilliam 
Giffard ofYorkc, becaufe he ofYorke aduanced his Croffe, as hee paffed 
through Kent towards the general 1 Counccll. 

The like happened allb, at two other fcucrall times, betweene Frier 
Feckham^ Archbifliop of Canterbury,and Wiilim wickwane^ and lohn de 
Romay Archbiftiops ofYorke, in the day es of King Edward the firft. At 
the length, the matter being yet once more (ct on foote, betweene Simert 
Ipp (the Archbifliop of this Prouincc, and his aducrfaric the incumbent 
ofYorkefor that time) King Edward the third, in whole raigne that vari^ 
ance was reuiued, refumed the matter into his owne hand, and made a fi- 
nall compofition betweene them. The which hee publiflied vndcr his 
broade Seale to this effed. Firft, that each of them Ihould freely, and 
without impeachment of the other, beare vp his Croffe in the others Pro¬ 
uincc; but yet fo, that he ofYorke and his Succclfours for eucr, in figne of 
fubieftion, fliould within two moneths after their inthronization, either 
bring, or (end to Canterbury, the image of an Archbiflbop bearing a 
Croffe,orfomcothcrlcwell,wroughtinfine gold, to the value of fomty 

pounds.

I pounds, and offer it openly there vpon Saint Thorny Beckets Shrync; 
then, that in all Synodcs of the Ckrgic, and aflcmblies where the King 
Cbould happen to bee prelcntjhec of Canterbury Ibould haue the right 
hand,and the other the left. Finally, that in broad ftrcets,and high-wayes, 
their Crofle-bearers flaould go together, but that in narrow lanes, and in 
the entries of doores and gates, the Crofier of Canterbury ftiould go be. 
fore, and the other follow, and come bchinde. 

Thus (as you fee) the Bifhops of Canterbury euermore preuailing by 
fauour, or other meanes* they of Yorkc were driuen in the end,to giue oucr 
in the plaine field.

When as mUfAmiht Conquerour built the great white fquarc Tower 
of London, hec appointed this Btfliop to bee principall Surueyor of that 
worke * who was for that time lodged in the houfe of one Edmere a Bur-,

words.

This Bilhop built a great part of the Caftleof Rochefler, namely, the 
great Tower which yet ftandeth. Hec founded an Hofpitall in Chetham, 
which hee dedicated to the honour of Saint Bartholomew the reliefc of 
filch people as were infeded w ith the foulc difeafe of the Lcprofic; hec en¬ 
dowed It with fufficient reucnuesjwhich grant was confirmed by king Hen¬ 
ry the third, and difeharged of all taxes, and tallages,by King Ed. the third. 

He founded the Abbey at Mailing, which he confccrarcd to the blefled 
Virgine, and placed therein blackc Nunnes. Which Nunnery hegouerned 
himfclfe during all his life time. And lying at the point of death, hee com¬ 
mended it to the charge of one ^uice,to whom not withftanding he would 
not deliuer ?he Paftorall ftaffe, before fhec had promifcd canonicall obedi¬ 
ence, fidelitie, and fubiedion to the Sec of Rocheftcr 5 and protefted by 
oath, that there (hould neither AbbefTe nor Nunne bee from thenceforth 
receiued into the houfe, without the confent and priuiric of him and his 
Siicccflburs. This Nunnery was valued at thefupprefflon, at two hundred 
fourty fiuc pounds, ten (hillings two pence halfepeny ofyearcly rcuenuc. 
Ouer the Abbey gate yet ftanding,is the likenefle of a Paftorall ftaffc.This 
good Bilhop dyed the feuenth of March, 1107. and was buried where you

occafion whereof, hec tooke away from them all their moueablc goods, all 
the ornaments of their Church, their writings and euidcnccs, yea and a 
great part of their lands, polTcflions and priuiledges; wanting money to

King Edward the fecond. This man built much at his Mannor houfes of 
Trofcliffc and Ha wling. In the To wne of Hithe before named,he founded 
the Hofpitall of Saint BartheUmew^ for reliefe of ten poorc people, endow¬ 
ing the fame with twenty Markesof yearcly reuenuc; He refigned his Bi- 
Ihopricke into the Popes hands, of whom he had rccciued confccration in 
the Court at Rome, i35a.andliucd aboutfome fix y cares after that 
a priuate life with the Monkes in this Priory .This Bifhop (faith the booke 
of Rochefter) bought a precious Miter which was Thomos Beckets^ of 
theExecutours of the Bi(hop of Norwich, which hce offered at the high 

Altar, on S. Pauls day, 1317. r l- u- 

John de Shefey, fo likewifc furnamed from the place of his birth, vpon 

Haymo his refignation, was by the Pope cleded to this Bifhoprick 5 hec 
was Lord Treafurer of England,in the two and thirtieth yeere of King Ed* 
ward the third, in which office he continued about three yeercs, cuen vn- 
till his death, which happened the nineteenth of Oftober, 1360. His 
portraiture is in the wall ouer his place ofBuriall.

cefter, of which order he was Prouinciall; Vir atatefua ah omni parte do- 
dus: So that in regard of his great learning, and painfulncs in preaching, 
he was preterred firfi: to the Bifhoprick of Saint Afaph, by King Henry the 
fixt, and after that tranflatcd to this of Rochefter 5 hce writ diuers learned 
works, and was a careful! fcarcher after good bookes, fb as diuers copies of 
feme ancient Fathers had vttcrly perifhed but for his diligWice. Hee died

departed toward Canterbury, but ere he had gone farre from the Citic, his

much admired, and became very famous.The Pope made him his Peniten- 
ciarie, and beftowed vpon him this Bifhoprickc ofRochcfter3he being be¬

wooll-fels, clothes, lead, and Tinne, and fuch like commodities of our 
Land, for the vtterance of them by the great.

And here giuc me Icauc(curtcous Reader) toturne backe to this Church 
fitua^te ncarc Rochefter,onely to fet downe a ftrange buriall in this Church¬ 
yard, thus related by Lamb Ar dm his perambulation of Kent. 

Although f faith hej Ihaucnot hitherto,at any time, readc any memo¬ 
rable thing recorded in Hiftory, touching chethdm it fcIfc,yct,for fo much 
as I hauc often heard ('and that conftantly reported ) a Popifh illufion done 
at that place; and for that alfo it is as profitable to the keeping vndcr of fai- 
ned and fupcrftitious religion, to renew tominde thc Prieftly praftifesof 
old time (which are declining to obliuionj as it is pleafint to retainc in 
memory the monuments and Antiquities of whatfoeuer of other kinde: I 
thinkc it not amifle, to commit faithfully to writing, what 1 haue recemed 
credibly by hearing, concerning theIdds, fometimeknowneby the names 
of our Lady, and the Roode of Ghethamand Gillingham. It happened 
(fay they) that the dead corps of a man ('loft through (hipwrackc belike) 
was caft on land in the Pariih of Cbetham,&amp; being there taken vp, was by 
forae charitable perfons committed to honeft buriall within their Church¬ 
yard: which thing was no fooncr done, but our Lady of Ghethara finding 
her ftlfc offended therewith,arofc by night,andwent in pcrlbn to the houfe 
of the PariQ3-Clerk(which then was in the ftrcct,a good diftance f roro the 
Church) and making a noife at his window^awaked him. This man at the 
firft (as commonly it fareth with men difturbed in their reft) demanded, 
fomc what roughly, who was there: But when he vndcrftood by her ownc 
anfwcr, that it was the Lady of Ghethara, he changed his note, and moft 
mildly asked the caufeof her comming.She told him, that there was late 
ly buried neare to the place where (he was honoured, a finfull pcr(bn,which 
(o offended her eye with his gaftly grinning,that,vnleffc he were remoued, 
(he could not, but (to the great griefe of good people) withdraw her fclfe 
from that place, and ceafe her wonted miraculous working iri that place 
amongft them. And therefore (he willed him to go with her, to the end that 
(by his hclpc) (he might take him vp and caft him againe into the Riuer. 
'The Clerkc obeyed, aroft and waited on her toward the Church: but the 
good Lady (not wonted to walke) waxed weary of the labour, and there¬ 
fore was enforced, for very want of breath, to fit downe in a bulh by the 
way, and there to reft her. And this place (forfooth) as alfo the whole track 
of their ioumey (remaining cucr after a grecnc path^ the Towne-dwcllers 
were wont to fticw. Now after a while, they go forward againe, and com- 
ming to the Churchyard, digged vp the body, and conueyed ilto the wa¬ 
ters fide, where it was firft found. 

This done, our Lady (hranke againe into her Shrine, and the Clerkc 
packed home to patch vp his broken fleepe, but the corps now eftfoones 
floaccd vp and downe the Riuer, as it did before. Which thing being at 
length efpied by them of Gillingham, it was once more taken vp and buri¬ 
ed in their Church-yard. But fee what followed vpon it, not oncly the 
Roode of Gillingham (fay they) that a while before was bufieinbeftow-

The fields about this Village arc filled with the dead bodies of many 
braue Souldiers, here flaine in two famous fee battels; whereof the one 
happened amongft the Saxons thcmfelucs, contending for glory and fii- 
prerae Soucraigntic. The other betwccnc the Danes and Saxons 5 ftriuing

here with his difeomfited fouldicrs, or at Canterbury with his royail An- 
ceftours, is to me vncertainc: 

In the fccond battell, Edmund the Monarch of the Englifhmen ( fiirna-

moft honourable vidoryj committing vpon the Danes fuch (laughter, and 
bloudy hauockc, that if they had not better trufted to their hccics then to 
their bands (flying toward the IflcofShepey) hee had that day made an 
end of the whole Danifh armic: and by all likelihood the warres had ceafed 
betwixt thofe two Nations for eucr. In this battell Canute loft foure thou-

fought in the ycarc, 1 ox^. 

OntBartilmew (ftith Lamhard) a Saint,was holdcn in great veneration 
at this Townc of Otford.His fcaft day was kept folcrtinly here, both with a 
faire and good fare, cucr vpon Saint ^artholomems day *. he was much fre¬ 
quented (by the Parifhioncrs and neighbours about) for a moft rare and 
Angular propertie that he profelTed. For the manner was, that if any wo¬

i lofe their freedome, purpofe to encounter with the Duke for their coun¬

an appointed day they mcete all at Swanefcombe, and harbouring* them- 
fclucs in the woods, with Boughs in cuery mans hand, they incompaffe his 
way. The next day, the Duke comming by Swanefcombe, feemedtofee 
with amazement,as it were a wood approaching towards him; the Kcntifh 
men at the found of a Trumpet take tbcmfclucs to Armes, when prefently 
the Archbifhop and Abbot ^wfent to the Duke, and faluted him with 
thefc words: Behold, Sir Duke, the Kcntifh come to meetc you, willing to 
receiucyou as their Liege Lord, vpon that condition , that they may fpr 
cuer enioy their ancient Liberties and Lawcsvfcd among their AnccBorSi 
other wife, prcfcntly offering warre; being ready rather to die, then vnder-

thefe tenures long fince hauc beene fo indifferently mixed and confounded 
in the hands of each fort, that there is not now any note of difference to be 
gathered by them.

the commodities whereof, the fuperfluousfruitcs of the ground be dcarely

Thefe Gentlemen bee all (for the moft part) acquainted with good let¬

arid departed out of the Realme for altogether. Thus farre in effeft outof 
Lambard. Briefly, faith Selden^ it had the firft Englifh King 5 in it was the

Now here, before I take my leaue of this little See of Rochefter, Ft (hall 
not feemc impertinent (1 hope) to (hew, with what great courage and hap- 
pinefle this Church hath euer vpholden her rights and priuiledges, not 
onely againftthc Monkes of Canterbury (which laboured much to bring 
I it vnder) butalfo againfl: the Sec itfclfe of the Archbifhops. 

For example, in the raigne of king the third, and after the death 
of Benedt^. (the Bifliop of Rochefter) the Monkes made choife ofone Hen* 
ry Sanford (that great wife Clerke, which preached at Sittingbourne, that 
fuch a day thefoules of king Richard the firft, Stephen Langton&gt; Archbi- 
fhopof Canterbury, and another Prieft, were deliucred out of PurgatO' 
ry, and nomorcfoulcs that day, but onely they three, as God badreuca- 
led it vnto him three feuerall times j whereof when the Monkes of Chrift- 
Church had intelligence, they refifted the ele(Rion,Yhallenging that the 
Paftorall ftaffc or Crofyer of Rochefter ought of very right to be brought 
to their houfe, after the deccafe of the Bifhop, and that the ele&lt;ftion ought 
robe made in their Chapiter. The Monkes of Rochefter maintained their 
owne choife, and fo the matter waxing warmebetweene th€m,it was at the 
length referred to the determination of the Archbifhop: he againe pofted it 
ouer to certainc Delegates, who hearing the parties, and weighing the

proofcSjgaucfcntcnce with the Monkes of Rochefter, and yet loft (as they 
thought) good loue and amity among them. But (as the Poet faith) Male 
fartagratia^ nequieqaam coit^fed rejcindituri Fauour that is euill pccced, 
will not ioync clofe, but fallcth afundcr. And therefore this their opinion 
failed them, and their cure prouedbut to be patched; for fooric after, the 
fore brake out anew, and the Canterbury Monkes reuiued their difplea- 
fure with fuch a heat, that Hubert of Burgh^ Earle of Kent, and chiefe lu- 
ftice of England, was driuen to come into the Chapter houfc and coole it, 
and to worke a (ccond reconciliation betweene them. Neither for all that 
(as it may feeme) was that flame quite extinguiihed. For not long after, 
'viz,, K^rtn. 1238. the Monkes of Chrift-Church feeing that they them- 
fclues could not preuaile, intituled their Archbiihop Edmund, with whom 
alfo the Rochefter Monkes waged law at Rome before the holy Father (as 
touching the eledion of Richard Wendeouer, whom they would haue bad 
Biftiop) by the fpace of three whole yearcs together: and at the length, 
either through the equitic of the caufc, or the weight of their purfc (faith 
my Author) ouerthrew him, vpon Saint Cuthberts day, in ioy whereof, 
they returned home with all haft, and ena^ed in their Chapter houfc,that 
from thenceforth,for cuer. Saint Cuthberts fcaft (as a Trophey of their vi- 
Aory) ftiould be boldcn double, both in their Church and Kitchin. 

And not thus onely, but otherwifc alfo, bath the See at Rochefter well 
holdcn her ownc; for during the whole fiicceffion of fburcfcorc Bifhops 
and one (as I haue faid before) which in right line haue followed lufim, fhc 
hath continually maintained her chaire at this one place: whereas in moft 
parts of the Rcalmc befides, the Secs of the Bifhops haue fiifFcrcd fundrie 
cranflations,by rcafbn that in the Conquerours time, order was taken,that 
filch Bifhops, as before had their Churches in countrey Townes and Villa¬ 
ges, fhould forthwith remoue, and from thenceforth remaine In walled 
Townes and Cities: which ordinance could not by any meancs touch Ro- 
chefter^ that was a walled Citie long time before king Williams gouern-

Cmd.^iMefex 


S before I hauefaid fbmewhat of the Cities of Canterbury 
and Rochefter^fo giuc me leauc to (peak a little of this great 
Citie of London, collected out of as well ancient as roo- 
derne writers. And firft I will borrow a few lines from John 
lohnfiofty before remembred, fometimes Profeflburof Diui- 
nitie in the Vniuerfitie of S. Andrewes in Scotland: who in 
agrauenote and ferious ftile compiled certaine Latine verfcs inpraifeof 
this our Metropolis, or fbucraigne Citie of this Ifland. Which I finde to 
be tranflated by Philemon HolLandy thus. 



This Citie well AM^nJla call’d, to which (a truth to fay) 

Aire, Land, Sea, and all Elements, ftiew fauour euery way. 

The weather no where milder is, the ground moft rich to fee. 
Doth yeeld all fruits of fertile foile, that ncuer fpent will be: 

And Ocean, that with Tams ftreame his flowing tidedoth blend 
Conuey es to it commodities,all that the world can fend. 

The noble feat of Kings it is, for port and royalty. 

Of all the Realme the tence.the heart, the life, and lightfome ey. 
The people ancient, valourous,expert in chiualry. 

Enriched with all forts and nvcancs of Art and Myftery. 

Take hcedfull view of euery thing, and then fay thus in briefe. 
This either is a world it felfe, or of the world the chiefe. 


Sir Robert ^aBingtonknightym his view of France;comparing the City 
of Paris with London, faith. That Paris is the greater, the fairer built, and 
the better feituate: London is the richer, the more populous, the more an¬ 
cient, which is an honour as well to great Cities, as to great families. And 
more ancient it is then any true Record bearcth witnefle, faith S^eed.fahu- 
led from BruteTroynouanty from LudLudJlone\ but by more credible wri¬ 
ters 5 TacituSy Pfolemy, an6\Antomne^ Londinium ; by \^miams Mar- 
cellinus for her focceffiue profperitic, Augufia^ the greatefl title that can be 
giuento any. 

It was the firft built Citie queftionlefle of all in the kingdome.Of which

This being a man ofno more cminencie in the Church then

proue)thofe thirtie Canons vpon the primarie inftitution, called Canons 
Regular (becaufc they led a regular life, and were perpetually refident) and 
afterwards liuing abroad, and ncglefting the bufincffe of their Church, be¬ 
came to be called Canons fccular, contenting thcmfclueswith the title of 
Canon, andfome prebend affignedvnto them. Which annexing of lands 
to the Prebcndaric was not till a long time after the firft foundation: where¬ 
upon Pope Lucius by his Bull ordained, that the Canons non-refident, 
fibould not partake of the profits of the lands affigned to the common af¬ 
faires of the Church, but oncly fuch as were refident (the diuifionof the 
Churches lands hauing bcene made before in the time of the Conquerour) 
this Laurence ^llerthorpy^it and before the time of his Treafurfhip,

Oracle, facred to Dhna.Brute himfelfe kneeling before the IdolJ, and hold¬ 
ing in his right hand a boule prepared for facrihee full of wine,&amp; the bloud

In feats of fiirc abode, where Temples we may dight 
For Virgines that (hall found thy laud with voices (hrill.

Thus much of king Brute y as the brute of him goes, and as the vulgar 
recciued opinion is, the maine points of his ftory being brought into que- 
ftion by many of our learned authcnticall writers. 


The Conquerour William brought with him from Roane in Normandy 
certaine Iewcs,whofepofterity here inhabiting within the prime Cities of 
thckingdome,didvferomctimcstofteale away, circumcifc,crownc with 
thornesT whip, torture, and crucifie fome one of their neighbours male chiL 
drcn,in mockery, defpicc, fcornc, and derifionof our Lord and Sauiour 
lefus Chrift,cruciEed by the Icwcs in lerufalem. 

In the yeare 1135. the ip.oto«.the third, feuen lewcs were brought 
before the king at Weftminftcr, which at Norwich had ftolne a boy, and 
kept him from the fight of Chriftian people, for the fpacc of one whole 
yeare, and had circumcifed him, minding alfo to haue crucified him at the 
folemnitie of Eafter, as therafclues confcfled before the king^ whereof they 
were conuided,their bodies and goods remaining at the kings pleafure. 

In the 39. ofthe faid kings raigne, vpon the 2 2. day ofNouember. one 
hundred and two lewcs were brought from Lincolnc to Weftralnfter, and 
there accufed, for the crucifying of a child of eightyearcs old,namcd Hugh: 
thefe lewcs were vpon examination fent to the Tower: the murthcr came 
outby thcdiligentfcarchmadcby themother ofthe childcj eightecncof

vfc. 

But to rcturne bseke againc to the ftory of the martyred boy, in dcroga- 
tion and defpite of Chriftian Religion. 

Vpon the day •f the Kalends of A uguft, the 

body ofayoung boy,in the Church-yard of S. at Paules*wharfe, was 

found buried, vnder whofe paps certaine Hebrew letters were inferibed: 
vpon his body diuers prints,marke$,*cuts,andrchts,.caured by rods and 
whip-cords, bcfides many other fignes Of various tortricnts,by thefaid boy 
fuftained, wereeafieto be difeerned. The name of the boy was found out 
by thofcCharacters; and withall, how that hec was foW by his Chriftian 
j parents: but by whom, or to which of the Icwes hee was fold, or to what 
end, could ncuer be knowne. Howfoeuer it was concludedithat the buyers 
of the boy intended to haue had him crucified. Yet crucified he was not; 
in regard no print of the nailes,Hther in his hands or feet, or any wound in 
his fide appeared. Many miracles wer^ faid to be wrought at the graue,and 
by the reliques of this young innocent Martyr. Whereupon the Canons 
of Saint Pauls Church, tooke forcibly away the facred remaines of this 
holy Martyr, out of the faid Church-yard, and folcmnly cnfhrincd them in 
their ownc Church, not farrefrom the high Altar. 

On the North fide of this Church was fometirac a great Cloyfter, inui- 
roninga plot of ground,called,Pardon Church-yard, whereof Thomas 
More^ Deane of Pauls^v/as either the firft buiIder,or an cfpeciall benefador, 
and was therein buried. 

In this Cloyfter were buried many perfohs; fome of worfhip, and fome 
of honour. The Monuments ofwhom (faith Stew in his furuay of London) 
in number and curious workmanfhip, pafled all other that were in the great 
Church. 

About the Cloyfter, was artificially and richly painted the dance of 
Death, commonly called, the dance of PrfW/, the Pidure of death leading 
all eftates? 

In the midft of this Pardon Church-yard, was a faire Chappell, firft 
founded by (Portgraue and principall Magiftrate fas now 

the Lord Maior is) of this Citic, father of T ho, Becket the Martyr, Arch- 
bifhop of Canterbury) who was therein buried; in the raigne of King 
Stef hen. Thomas More Deane of Pauls ^ before mentioned, reedified,or new 
builded this Chappell, and founded three Chaplaines there in the raigne 
of ffenry the fifth. 

In the yeare 154P. on the tenth of Aprill, the faid Chappell, by com¬ 
mand ement of Edward Duke of Somerfet, Lord Protedor, was begun to 
be pulled do wne, with the whole Cloyfter, the Tombes and Monuments: 
fo that nothing of them was left, but the bare plot of ground,which is fince 
conuerted intoa garden, for the Petty Canons. 

There was a Chappell at the North doore of founded by Walter

place thereof an houfe builded.- 

There was on the North fide of Pauh Churchyard, a large charnell- 
houfe for the bones' of the dead, and ouerit a Chappell, founded vpon this 
occafion as followeth. 

In the yeare 1281. the tenth of Edward the firft,it was agreed, that 
Henry Wallets Citizens, for thecaufe of Shops by them 

builded, without the wall of the Church-yard, fliould affigne to God, and 
to the Church of Saint Partly ten Markes of rent by the yeare for eucr, to¬ 
wards the new building of a Chappell of the bleffed Virginc Mary^ and al¬ 
fo to affigne fiuc Markes of yearely rent to a Chaplainc to celebrate there. 

And in the yeare 1450. the 8. of Henry the fixth, licence was granted 
to lenken Carpenter , 'Towne-clcrke of London (Executour to Richard

Sir Henry Barton knight (the (bnne of Henry Barton of Mildenhall in 
Suffolcke) Lord Maior of London, in the yeare 1427. Robert Barton^ and 
Siv Thomas knight (fonne to George Mirfin of Ely in Cambridge-

pourtraituresof Alabaftcr ouerthem, grated, or coped about with iron, 
before the faid Chappell 5 all which with many other Tombes ann Monu¬ 
ments of the dead, were pulled do^^me, together with the faid C happell 5 at 
the comcnandement likewife of the forenamed Duke of Somerfet. 

The bones of the dead couefiedvpin the Cfaarnell-houfe, vndcr the 
Chappell, were conuayed from thence into Finsbery field, amounting to 
more thenathoufand cart load (SmhStow) and there laid on amoorifli 
ground; in (here fpace after raifed, by foliage of the Citie vpon them , to 
beare three Mills. The Chappell and charncll-houfe were conuerced to 
dwelling houfes, warehoufes, and fheds before them for Stationers in place 
of the Tombes. 

Neare vnto this Chappell was a bell houfe with foure Bells, the great- 
eft in London,they were called lefus Bells,and belonged to Icfus Chappell, 
the fame had a great fpire of timber, couered with lead, with the image of 
Saint F4«/onthe top 5 which was pulled downe by Sir Mita Partridge 
knight, in the raigne of Henry the eight. The common fpcech then was 
(faith Stow ) that this Sir Mi/es Partridge did fet an hundred pound vpon 
a caft at dice againft it, and fo wonne the faid Bcll-houre and Bells of the 
King*, and then caufed the Bells to bee broken as they hung, and the reft

He gaue releefe in Newgate, and in the Fleet; and ten fliillings a yearc to 
Saint Giles Hofpitall by Oldborne for cuer. And other Legacies (faith 
Stow, fpcaking of the Honour of Citizens^ too long to rehcarlc. He died 
about the y eare 1^48, But of him I hauefpoken fomewhatbefore. 

Vnder the Quire of Pauls, is a large Chappell, dedicated to the name of 
lefu, by whom founded I do not know. But it was thus confirmed in the 
3 7. of Hen. the fixth, as appeareth by his patent thereof, dated at Crow- 
do wnc to this effed. 

Many Begc-men, and Chriftian people, hauing beguna Fraternitie,and 
Guild, to the honour of the moft glorious name of lefu Chrift our Sauiour, 
in a place called the Crowds of the Catbedrall Church of Pauls in Lon¬ 
don, which hath continued long time peaceably, till now of late. Where¬ 
upon they haue made requeft, and wee haue taken vpon vs the name and 
charge of the foundation, to the laud of Almighty God, the Father, the 
Sonne, and the holy Ghoft, and elpecially to the honour of lefu, in whole 
honour thcFraternitic was begun, &amp;:c. / 

It was like wife confirmed by Hen. the 7. the 21. of his raigne, and by H. 
8.the27.of hisraigne.

I gather by the premifles, howfbeuer I may be miftaken, I confeiIe,that 
the Court of Delegates is kept at this day, in the very place of the old 
Chantrlc; 

Many Chantrics&gt; Chappels, Oratories, Altars and Shrines, more then

and ^he new Fabrickc from the ground is fourefcorc and eight foot high.

Ifyou would know the greatnefle of the great Church of our Lady,the 
roofethercof is feuentecne fathome high 5 it is twenty and ^re fathome 
broad, fixtie and fiue fathome long 5 the two Steeples arc thirtie and foure 
fathome high abouc the Church, and all founded vpon piles. 

Now I leaue it to my Reader (taking a fathome for an Ell) to make the 
difference betwixtthc ample extenfure ofthefc two religious ftrudurcs. 

Since the building and foundation of this Church and Bilhopricke of 
London by King Ethelbert (which is much-what abouta thoufend and 
twenty fixe ycarcs ago) cightie ahd nine Bilhops hauc fuccceded one ano- 
therin this Hierarchie or holy gouernance, which at this day is right wor¬

and prudent Statef-man, IVilliamLaudyOncothh Maiefties moft honou¬

And thus I will take leauc of this facred Edifice, and make a few fteps 
downc into the Pari(h Church of Saint Faitb-, commonly called, S. Faiths

nourable increafers, Rulers and preferuers of all fuch matters which con¬ 
duce CO Ghriftian pictic, and the defence of the Bifliops power and aur 
thoritic. 

In the Sec of Rome, at this day, they hauc thcchiefcftcharge,and are di- 
uided into three orders, that is to lay, of Bilbops,Priefts,and Deacons: not 
that the Cardinals Priefts be no Bilhops,or that the Deacons be not Priefts 
and Bilhops, but for that their fij ft inftitution was fuch, Ibme to Carrie the 
titles of Bilhops, others ol Priefts, and Ibme of Deacons. 

The Cardinalls which are Biftiops, lit neare vnto the Pope, when bee 
doth celebrate Fcftiuall dayes: The Cardinalls Priefts affift him when he 
laith MalTe: and the Deacons attire him, and feruc him at the Altar. 

They hauc there their Gollcdgc, whereof the Pope is head \ the number 
ofihcmhathnotbccnecertaincinour dayes rat tnistime there are about 
fixty and cight^although we find that in former ages,they were but twcluc, 
after the example of the Apoftlcs; They aflemble thcmfclues together once 
or twice a weeke, as affaires of importance come to their confiderationsjand 
this their afiemblie is called the Confiftory 5 where they treat (or at leaft 
they ought to treat) of all things, which belong vnto the faith and Reli¬ 
gion; to the peace of Chriftians,and to the prcleruation of the temporall 
eftate of the Church. 

I finde nothing of Cardinalls vntill the dayes of Gregdry the Great ^^0 
tem'poreBpfcoftindijftrcnterCArdmdes faciebant^et Papa Cardlmles in . 
Epifeopospromouebat. Yet fomc are ofopinion, that the firft beginning of' 
Cardinals was in the time of Pomianus the Pope, which was circa Ann. 
23 1 , and MarceUus after him, circa Ann. 304. ordained fiftccnc, or rather 
twenty fiuc Cardinals in the Citie oiKomt^prepter Baptijmata et fipultu^ 
ras beminum. And when as firft thefc Cardinals were inftituted in theRo- 
manc Church, Pauperculierant Roma in fuistitulis babitantes.Thcy were 
poorcand ncccffitous, lining at Rome in their owne titles. 

And Gregory the Great, in one of his Epiftics to Maximian the Biftiop 
of Syracula, writes the like of the poucrtic of one -Fe//Ar,a Deacon Cardi¬ 
nal!. For whofcliiftcnrationhcthusprouidcsl

Howlbcuer then, that the Cardinals of Rome at this day doc abound in 
all affluence of riches^ and like ftacely Cedars, looke oucr the (mailer fprigs 
ofthe Clcrgie: yet confidering the Primiciuc times,our Cardinals of Saint 
Pauls arc not to be contemned for their meane compctencic of liuely hood; 
hauingfufficienttomaincaine their rcuerenc comportment. Of whom giuc 
me Icaue to Ipeakc a little out of the Records of the Church. 

The Church of Saint had before the time of the Conqucrour,two 
Cardinalls, which office ftill continues. 

They arc chofen by the Deane and Chap ter,out of the number of the 
twelue petty Canons, and are called Gardinales chori: the Cardinals of the 
Quire.

This Houfe was founded by Rohrt Kilwardhy Archbifhop oiCanter-

wards the latter end of his time, made a colleftion, faith Godwin, for the 
building of a Monafteriefor the Fryer Minors in London. Many contri¬ 
buted fo largely thereunto, as he (hauing theheipe ofa certainc old Tower 
which yecldcd him ftones without charge) finifhed the fame with other 
mens money, and was able to aJfoord the foundation for another at Salif- 
bury. King EdwardihzM and Eleanor his wife, were great Benefactors 
to this worke. This wasalargc Church, richly furnifhed with ornaments, 
and honoured by the burials of many great Pcrfbnages.-diuers Parliaments 
and other great meetings hauc bccnc holden in this Monafteric, which is 
now aitogetherdemoliSied,andother new buildings ercCfed in the lame 
place. This order of blacke Fryers Predicants were remoued hither from 
Oldbourne, where they had continued, 55 yeeres. The reuenewe of this 
houfe was valued at 1041.15 s. 5 d fer annum, being furrendred into the 
Kings hands, 12 cdiNouember^mt 50 of Henry the 8.

at Shine, in new glafing the windowes, cither vpona foplilh pleafurc, or

therein the head of a man retaining fauour; though the moyfture were 
cleane dried vp, whofe haire both of Head and Beard was red; which, af¬ 
ter he had well viewed, and a while kept, he caufed to bee buried in Saint 
Michaels Woodftrect, London, the Church of the Parilh wherein himfcifc 
dwelled. 

That the Head of this valorous King lieth here inhumed, wee muft be- 
leenc the words of the Relator^ for I finde no Monument or outward appa- 
ranee of it in the Church. That his body {not found till the day after the 
battcll,and then not knowneor deferiedi becaufc of his many wounds, 
fane oncly by the Lord Dacres) was interred amongft the Carthufians in 
the Priory of Shine at Richmond, I haue, out of an old Manufcripr,thc 
teftimony of a man which fawhis Sepulchre, the fameyeareof his death in

There Gyants whilomc dwelt, W'bofeclothcs were skins of beafls, 
Whofe drinke was bloud; whoft cups, to feme for vfe at feafts. 
Were made of hollow wood; whofe beds were bulhiethornes • 
And Lodgings rockie caues, to fhelter them from ftormes. • 

Their chambers craggie rocks, their hunting found them meat, 
i o rauiui and to kill, to them was plcafurc grear. 

Their violence was rule, with rage and forie led, 

They ruiht into the fight, and fought band oucr head. , 

Their bodies were interred behinde fome bulb or brake; 

To bearefuchmonftrous wights,the earth did groneand quake.

In a word, my Author makes Corincm to get the vpper hand of Gog - 1 
magogi and to caft him hcadlongfrom one of the rocks not farre from Do- 
ucr, which for a longtime was called the fall or leape of Gogmagog^ and af- 
terwards the fall of Douer.And this Gogmagog^iaith he, was the laft ofthat 
monftrous generation. 

Rafh the Monke of Coggefhall who wrote aboiie three hundred yeares 
ago, faith, that in king Richards time, on the fea (hore at a Village in Eflex, 
called Eadulphneffe, were found two teeth of a certaine Giant, of fuch an 
huge bigneffe, that two hundred fuch teeth, as men haue now a dayes, 
might be cut out of them. Thefe faw I at Goggelhall (quoth he) and not 
without wondring. And fiich another €iant-Iike thing, I wot not what, 
faith C4We/^, was in the beginning of Queene Elizabeths raigne, digged 
vp by Jt. Candi/ht a Gentleman neare to this place. Vpon which thus he 
doth further comment. 

I do not denie (faith he) but that there haue beene men, that for their 
huge bodies, and firme ftrength, were wondrous tobeholdj whom God, as 
Saint Auftirt faith, would haue to line vpon the earth: thereby to teach vs, 
that neither beauty of bodie, nor taleneflcof ftaturc, are to bee accounted 
fimplie good things, feeing they be common, as well to Infidels, as to the 
godly. Yet may we very well thinke, that which Suetonius hath written, 
namely, that the huge limmes of monftrous Sea* creatures elfe where,and in 
this kingdomealfo, were commonly faid and taken to haue beenc Giants 
bones. 

Another iudicious Antiquarie of thefe times doth alfo thus illuffrate 
this point. I could thinke, faith hec, that there now are forae as great fta- 
turcs, as for the moft part haue beene* and that Giants were but of a fbme- 
what more then vulgar excellence in body, and martiall performance. If 
you obied the finding ofgreat bones,which meafured by proportion large¬ 
ly exceed our times. I firft anfwer, that in fome fingulars, as Monfters ra¬ 
ther then natural!, fuch proofc hath beene 5 but that now and of ancient 
time, the eyes iudgement in fuch like hath beene, and is, fubied to much 
impofturc,miftaking bones of huge beafts for humane. Claudius brought 
ouer his Elephants hither, and perhaps lulius Cefir fome (for 1 haue read 
that he terriblie frighted the Britons, with fight of one at Coway Stakes, 
when he paffed ouer Thames) and fo may you bee dcceiucd. But more of 
Giants hereafter. •

fbllowingouer the Church doorein the ftone worke, that this holy Stru-

ThisHofpirallwasan'cicntly founded by the Citizens of London, for 
fourtecnc Sifters maidens, that were leprous, lining chaftly and honcftly. 
This Hofpitall was furrendred to Henry the eight, the 25 of his raigne; the 
Sifters being compounded withall, were allowed Penfions for the terme of 
thcirliues;and the King builded therea goodly manner houfc annexine 
thereunto a Parke. ® 


rhe Foundation of the religious houfe of Conuerts in Chancerielane^ 
{anciently called Netofreete,) now knome hy the 
name of the Holies. 

Henry the third, about the twentieth yeare of his raigne, built this houfe 
for the Iewcs,conuerted &amp; to be conuerted to the faith of Chrift; thefeare 
the words in his grant.

i And fome laid chat it was goddi? owne werthc as the prophccye fayd: 
That Englylhcmen fholdc bedeftroyed by Danes, by Frcidlie mcn, and 
byScottes. V 

Of this prophcticall predidion I haue fpoken elfewhere, which (like as 
that of the marble ftone) vpon the inauguration of our lace Soucraigne 
Lord King of happie memory,in his Regall Chairc of impenall 
gouernment, had full accompli Qimcnt. 

The period ofthedayes, as alfo the character of this magnificent Mo¬ 
narch Edward, arc thus dcliuered by a late Writer. 

In luly, 1507 although he found himfelfc not well, he enters Scotland 
with a frefti Army, which he fed not farre^ for falling into a Diflentcrie, he 
dies at Borough vpon thefands^as if to (how on what foundation bee had 
built all his glory in this world : hauing raigned thirty fourc yeares,feiien 
[ moncths,aged ri)«ty eight. A Prince of a generous fpiric, wherein the fire 
[ held outeuen to the very laft: borne and bred for adion and militarie af 
! faircs, which hemannaged with great iudgeraenc: cuer warie and proui: 

I dent for his owne bufinefle: warchfull and eager to enlarge his power: and 
I was more tor the greatneffe of England, then the quiet thereof. And this 
I we may iuftly (ay of him, that neuer king before, or fince, fhed (b much 
■ Chriftian bloud within this Iflc of Britaine, as this C^rifiian wartior did in 
his time, and was the caufe of much more in that following. 

By our great and iudicious Antiquary Camden., he is thus deportrayed, 

as folio weth. • i 

For no one thing was this little Burgh vpon S^fuds more famous»han, 
that King Edward the firft,thac triumph me Conquerour 'of his enemies, 
was here taken out of the world by vntimely death A right noble and wor¬ 
thy Prince, to whom God proportioned a mofi princely prcfcacc and per- 
j fonage, as aright worthy feat toentertainc fo heroical! a minde. For he not 
oncly in regard of fortitude and wifedomc, but aTo for a beautifull and per- 
’ fonall prefcncc was in all points anfwerablc to the height of Royall Maie- 
ftie, whom fortune alfo in the very Primeand flower of his age, inured to 
many a warre, and excrcifedin moft dangerous troublcsof the ftate, whiles 
fhe framed and fitted him for the Empire of Britaine- which he,being once- 
crowned King,maHnaged and gouerned in fuch wife, that hauingfub\lucd- 
the Weifh, and vanquiftied the Scots, hce naay moft iuftiy beecoun^da 

chiefe ornament and honour of Britaine. 

Amongft: other admonitions and precepts, which he gaue to his Tonne

make a Sonne fight nobly. Moreouer he commanded the faid Prince That 
whereas himfclfe, by the continuall new attempts of Bruce, king of Scot¬

and two thoufand pounds of filuer. That his Heart being fo by them con-

I cannot letpafle, although I dofomewhat digrefle, the cunning fleights

with the king to the vtter vndoing of all hisloyall Subieds.And now Pope 
^^lexandenht^omth puts a trickc vpon the king himfelfe (a Prince more 
pious then prudent) which exhaufts his Treafure, and leaues him for a 
laughing-ftocke to all other Nations. This Pope, fbrfooth, inuefted this 
Edmund his fbnne, into the kingdomes of Sicilia and Apulia {Conradus 
king thereof ftill liuing) by a ring 5 conditionally, that hee fhould fuftaine 
the charges, and mainrainc the warres that fhould happen thereupon. In 
which regard he fuckt amaffeof money from our credulous king 
who had fo deeply fwallowed the gudgeon that (his heart,being ouerdoy- 
ed ffaith 'Mathew Paris) and raifed cuen to the height of exultation^ hee 
fwpre by Saint Edward^ to make a prefent voyage to Apulia, and take poP 
feflion of thefe dominions. But at length this counterfeit ring vpon the 
touch was difcoucred, and the good king knew hirafclfc dduded, his Ex- 
chejquer emptied, and this Titulary-king his fbnne Edmund abufed. Thus 
i writes tMathew Paris, the Monkc ofS. Athans,^hf^ liued in thofedayes^

This Edmund was Lord Steward ofthis kingdomc, and Lieutenant of

T'he Hermitage At Kilhourne. 

In the time of King Henry the firft, Herbert Abbot of Wcftminfter, by 
permiflion of Biflabp of London, and by confentof thcGoiient, 
granted to three Maides the Hermitage of Kilbourne, with all the land of 
that place 5 which Hermitage one had builded long before. 


T . 

ihe Hof^itall ofS.Gilesinthe Fields for Leprous feo^le. 

This Hofpitall was founded by Q^cne Maude^ wife to king Henry the 
firftj in the yeare 1117. and was a Ceil belonging to Burton Lazers of le- 
rufaiem,in the County of Leicefterjas may appeare by a deed dated the 14. 
of Hen. 7. in thefc words. 

Thomas Norton knight, MaQer of Burton Lazers of lerufalem in Eng- 
land, and the brethren of the fame place, keepers of the Hofpitall of Saint 
Giles ^ without the Barresof the old Temple of London j haue fold to Gef 
frey Kentj Citizen, and Draper of London,a mefluage or houfe with two 
Sollars aboue, edified in the Parifti of Alhallowes Hony-lane in Weft- 
cbcapc,adioyningto the Weft part of a Tenement, called the Goate on 
the Hope, pertaining to the Drapers of London, for 31. 1 , 

At this Hofpitall the prifbners, conueyed from the Qtie of London to¬ 
wards Teyborne, thereto be executed, were prefented with a great Bowie 
of Ale, thereof to drinke at their pl^afurc 


. The HoJ^itall of Safnt Mary ^ethlem^ commonly called Bedlam. 

In the yeare 1 247. Simon Fit&amp;marj ^ one of the SherifFes of London, 
founded this Hofpitall for lame and indigent people, which afterwards was 
conuerted to that vfe, which the Citie now makes of it,vpon thisoccafion. 

In the Parilhof Saint in the field, there was an houfe wherein 
fometime were diftraught and Lunatickc people- of what antiquitie found¬ 
ed, by whom, or what* time fupprefted, faith Stow, I haue not read. But it 
was faid, that a King of England, not liking fuch a kinds of people to re- 
mainefo ncarc his Pallace, canfed them to be remoued further off, to Beth-

They were bothaccufed to be of the adherents to Eli:{abeth Barton in

of thair refufall thereof, I am vncertainc, and they wolde by no meanes ex-

In the fields on the North-Eaft and Eaft fide ofthe fuburbs, whiles I was

many vrnes, funerall veffels, little Images, and earthen jwts, wherein were

alsalfo,and fundrie fmall earthen veffels, wherein feme liquid fubftance 
remained which I would thinke to be eitherofthat facred oblation of wine 
and milke’, which the ancient Romanes vfed when they burnt the dead, or 
elte thofe odoriferous liquors that Statins mentioneth.

This place the Romanes appointed tobnrne and burie dead b^ies,

handles, like to our ftone lugs: thefe were emptie, but fiemed to be buried 
full of fome liquid matter, long fince confumed and foaked through. Foil 
there were found diuers vials, and other fafhioncd GlaflTes, fome. moft cun¬

found the fculls and bones of men without coffins,or rather whofc coffines 
(being of great timber) were confumed. Diuers great Nailes of Iron were 
there found, fuch as arc vfed in the whceles of Biod carts, being each of 
them as bigge as a man s fingcr,and a quarter of a yard,the heads two inches

great care and diligcncc,to reforme anew,and to adornc with iufticc,la wes, 
and good ordcrs,the Britilh commonwealth; by other Kings not fo framed 
as ftood with the greatnefic thereof. But as he was bufie in hand herewith, 
death tookc him away from thefe worldly employments, when hee had 
raigned 27. yeare^ • 

He had a wife named Marth ?robay2L woman of perFed bcautie, and 
wifedomc incomparable, as by her prudent gouernment, and equall admi- 
niftration of iuftice, after her husbands dcccale, during her Tonnes minori- 
tie, it moft manifeftly appeared. 

She was a woman expert and skilfull in diuers fticnccs, but chicfcly, be¬ 
ing admitted to the gouernment of the Realme, Ihe ftudied to preferue the 
commonwealth in good, quiet, and decent order; and therefore dcuifed, 
eftablifhed, and writ a bookc in the Britilh tongue of profitable and conue- 
nicnc Lawes,thc which after her name were called Martian Lawes. Thefe 
Lawes afterwards Gildas Cambriusy the Hiftoricall Welch Poet, tranfla- 
ted into Latine:and a long time after him, lured. King of the Weft 
Saxons, holding thefe lawes ncceffarie for the prelcruation of the common 
wealth, put them into Englilh Saxon fpeech, and then they were called af¬ 
ter that tranflation, Marchenelaghy that is to mcane, the Lawes of Martia . 
adding thereunto a Bookc of his owne writing of the Lawes of England, 
which he called, A certaine Breuiarie extraiftcd out of diuers Lawes of the 
Troians, Grecians, Britaines, Saxons, and Danes. Sheflourilhed before the 
birth of our Lord and Sauiour, 5 48. yearcs,or thereabouts. *

his full purpofe to driue them out, and from the feuenth ycarc after their 
firft entrance,for twenricycares continuance, fought many battailes with 
them, and foure of them with great puilTance in theopen field- in the firft 
whereof, they departed with like fortune^ and lofleof the Generals bre¬ 
thren Herfa and Latigern : in the other three, the Bricaines went away 
with vifftory, and fqlong, vntill Vortimer was taken away by fatall death. 

It is recorded of him, that after he had vanquifhed the Saxons, and difi 
poflefled them of all their footing in the Continent, yea, and often alTailed 
them in the Iflc of Tannet: the Church of Chrillianitie being ruinated by 
the Pagan marriage of Rowena with his Brother, as aforefaid, that he refto- 
red the Ghriftian Religion,as then forely decaied,and new built the Chur¬ 
ches that his enemies,the misbeleeuing Saxons had deftroied. 

It is alfo reported by of Bangor, in the faiftorieofhiscountrie, 

that after his laft vidoric ouer the Saxons, he caufcd his monument to be 
erefted at the entrance into Tanet, and in the fame place ofthat great ouer- 
throw, which by the (aid Author, is called Lafislituli^oi vs the Stonar^ 
where for certainc,it feemes, hath becne anhauen. In this monument, hcc 
commanded his body robe buried, to the further terror of the Saxons,that 
in beholding this his Trophie,their fpirits might be daunted at the remem¬ 
brance of their great ouertbrow. As Scipio Africanm conceited the like, 
who commanded his Sepulchre to be fo fct,tha|: it might ouerlooke Africa,* 
fuppofing that his very Tombe would be a terror to theCarthaginians.But 
how that defire of Vortimer was performed, I finde not, faith a late writer;

iuly,in the 19 ycare of his faid fathers raign,he was by Letters Patents, da¬ 
ted at Efthamfted,further honoured with the Earlcdomcs ofPenbrokeand 
March. He was proclaimed King, but neuer crowned, yet had not theani- 
bitiooshandofhisVnclebeene defiled in his innocent bloud, hee might 
baue worne the Diadem many yeares, whereas he bare the title of King no 
longer then two moneths and cightccne daies. 

Richard, furnamed of Shrewsbury, becaufc he was there borne, the fe- 
cond fonne of Edward the fourth, by his wife Elizabeth, as afbrefaid, was 
affianced in his infaneie,to Anne the oncly daughter and heire of lohn Lord 
.^&lt;?w^r4yDukeofNorfolkcihecwas honoured by the titles of Duke of 
Norfolkc, Earle Warren, Earle Marftiall, and Nottingham; alfo Lord Ba¬ 
ron of Mowbray, Segraue, and of Gower, as ^iUes will haue it5 but inioy, 
ing neither wife, title, or his owne life long, was with his brother, raurthe- 
red in the Tower of London,and in the prifon of that Tower, which, vp¬ 
on that mofl: finfull deed, is cuer fince called the bloudy Tower, their bo¬ 
dies as yet vnknowne whereto haue buriall. The ftorie of whofe death, and 
fuppofed interment, extracted out of authcncicall Authors, is thus deliuc- 
red by lohn Sfeed. 

Prince Edward mAKishtothex (faith hce) were both (hut vp in the 
Tower, and all attendants remoued from them, oncly one called Blaoke- 
Wifi, or mlliam Slaughter excepted, who was fet to feme them, and to fee 
lithem fore. After which time the Prince neuer tied his points,nor cared for 
himfcife,‘butwith thatyong Babe his brother, lingred with thought and 
heauineffe, till their trMterous deaths deliuered them out of that wretched- 
, neffe: for the execution whereof. Sir Idmes Tirrill appointed Miks For* 
\refl,3L fellow flefhed in miifther before time: to whom he ioyned one lohn

About midnight (all others being remoued from them) this Miles For* 
refi, and John Dighton^camcinto thcGhatriber, and fuddenly wrapped vp 
the fely children in the Bed-clothes'where they lay, keeping,by force, the 
featherbed and pillowes hard vpon their mouthes, that they were therein 
fmothcred to death, and gaue vp to God their innocent foules, into the 
ioyes of hcauen, leaning their bodies vnto the Tormentors, dead in the 
bed.* which after thefc monftrous wretches pcrcciucd,firft by the ftrugling 
with the paincsof death, and afterlbtig lying ftill to bee thorowly difpat-

bury them at the ftaircs foot, fomewhae deepc in the ground,vndcr a great 
heape of ftoncs.Then rode Sir I Ames in haftc to the King, vnto whom he 
(hewed the manner oftheir death, and place of buriallj which newes was 
fo welcome to his wicked heart, as hec greatly reioyced, and with great 
thankes dubbed (asfome hold) this his mcrcilcfle Inftrument, Knight.But 
the place ofthcirburiall he liked not, faying, that vile corner (liould not 
containc the bodies of thofe Princes, his Ncphewes,and commanded them 
abetter place for buriall, bccaufe they were the Sons of a King. Where¬ 
upon the Prieftof the Tower tookc^p their bodies, and fecretly interred 
them in (uch a place, which by the occafion of his death, could Dcucrfince 

come to light. ^ t . 

The continuer vs from the report of others, that 

YiXng Richard caulcd Sir Robert Erakenburies Prieft to clofc their dead 
corpes in lead, and fo to put them in a coffin full of holes, and hooked at 
the ends with two hookes of iron,and fo to caft them into a place called the 
Blackc deepes at the Thames mouth, whereby they (hould ncucr rife vp,

The firft bufinefle that this King vndertooke after hce came to the 
Crownc, was the reftauration of ancient priuilcdges to the Church, and 
great hope was conceiued of his further proceedings,had not God cut him 
off by vntimely death, the 17. day of September, in the yeare of our Lord 
God, 79(^. and in the firft of his raigne hauing had neither wife nor ifTuc. 
His bodie with all due obfequies was here Princely interred nearc to the 
Shrine of ^.K^lban* 

This Abbey Church was likewifc honoured with the Sepulture of Ro¬ 
bert Mombrayt Earle of Northumberland; whole ftorie out of many wri¬ 
ters is in this manner cxtrafled. 

This Robert Mowbray^ a moft valiant Souldier,feeing his countrey de- 
ftroyed, and ouerrunne eucn vnto Alnewicke cafl:Ie,by CMalcoime King of 
Scotland and his armie, made head againft the faid Malcolme (not Raying 
for directions from his King William Rufus) and (b fore and fuddenly di^ 
ftreffed bis forces, that both king Malcolme himfelfc,and his fonne Prince 
Edward were there flaine. 

Hereupon this Earlegrowing proud, and greatly fufpeCted by King Wil^ 
itam^ began to fortifie the Kings Gaftics, with munition for Armes againft 
the like inuafion, and indeed againft the Kings will; who fent him word 
Ibmewhat roughly, to defiftfrom his doings, and prefently to repaire to his 
prefence* which whileft he lingered and ncgleded todo,kingH^////4»i fent 
his brother Henry to fpoile Northumberland, and immediately followed 
after himfelfe, where without much adoc, he tooke the Earle, and commit¬ 
ted him prifoncr to Windfor Caftle. 

This Robert Mowbraym^ William Anco, with others, confpired to 
depriue the King both of Crownc and life, and to haue fet vp Stephen de 
Albamarle his Aunts Ibnne, as Heueden and Walfwgham will haue it. But 
I rcade in an old Manufeript that he fauouring the proceedings of Anfelme^ 
Archbifliop of Canterbury, Pr(7 amore^ bono Ecclefte innocentem vitam 
finiebat. Cuim anime profit ietur Deus, As the words are# Rexipfumeum 
alijs decollari mandauit: the king commanded that hc,wicb othcrs,Q3ouId 
be beheaded • his companion being puniftied with Ioffe both of 
his eyes, and his virilitic. 

He died in prifon, faith one writer. In ipfo Ergafulo deficient mortusa

moft part, here in England,the (aid King Henry gaue to Nigellde Albeney,

Another writer tells vs, that he married Maud^ the daughter of Riche- 
rius de Kjlquilay a potent man in the Conquerours dayes, and that after 
fburcandthirticyearcsofimprifonmcnt, hce died without iffac; in thefe 
words.

Saint Germans, 

About the yearc of the worlds redemption, 429. when as the Pelagian 
herefie budded forth afrefti in this Ifland,and Co polluted the Britifti Chur¬ 
ches, as that to auerre and maintainc the truth, they fent for German, Bi- 
fhop of Auxerre, the place of his birth (a man of raoche noble lygnage, 
taught and enformed wel in the Artes liberallc, lerned in the fcyencc of the 
Dccretces droytesand la we, faith his Cegend) and Zu/?us Bilhop of Troics 
out of France; who by refuting this herefie, gained vnto thcmfclues a re- 
ucrent^ccount among the Britains. but chiefly German, who hath at this 
day thorowout all this Ifland many Churches dedicated to his memorie. 
Now^ vnderftand, that neere to the walls of the old Gitie Verulam,was, 
as theii, a plot ofconfecrated ground, wherein the bodies of fuchas had 
profefledChriftianitie,and fuffered martyrdomc vnder the perfccution of 
the Romane Emperours, were interred In which the faid German openly 
(out of the pulpit) preached Gods word to the people j where afterwards 
the bclecuing Chriftians built this Chappell, and dedicated it to bis ho¬ 
nour* for that by his doffrine, and other good meanes, hce had conuei ted 
many thoufands to the true profeflSon of Chriftian Religion. This German 
commanded the Sepulchre of Saint 4/^4/; to be opened, and therein be- 
ftowed certaine r«liquesof Saints, that thofe whom one heauen had recei- 
ued, fliouldalfobe in one Sepulchre together lodged. Thus much (faith 
Camden) I note by the way,that ye may obferueand confider the fifliions of

reckoned for one of the Knights of the Garter, and in the abfence of his fa¬

much commended for his affabilitie and gentle deportment, as alfo for -his

head was ftricken off the nineteenth of June, 1311. at the commanderaent

ding by trial! of'his Peercs: which caufed a lafting hatred betwixt the King 
and his Nobles, and was the beginning of the fecond ciuill warre of Eng¬

dic of his Gaueflon to be transferred, with great pompe, from the place of 
his former buriall (which was among the Friers Preachers at Oxford^ to 
this Fricry of his ownc foundation (faith Stow,) Where he in perlbn with

Edward the fir ft, in companie with his fonne this Pnnee, which was tbe 
racancs that inaefted him into that high fauour of his; Hcc was ofa good¬

Armes, as he fhewed himfelfc in that Turneament which he held at Wal- 
lingford, wherein he challenged the beft of the Nobilitie, and is laid to 
haue foiled them all • which inflamed the more their malice towards him. 
In Ireland where he was Lieutenant, during the fhort time of his bariifti-

all, of carrying the Shield: as in old time among the Romanes, liich as were 
named Sfularij, whotookc that name either of the EfcutcheonsofArmes 
which they bare as Enfignes of their defccnt,or becaufc they were Armour- 
bearers to Princes, or to the better fort of Nobilirie. Ranulph Earle of Che- 
ftcr, giues Vullo ^Armigero fuo temmentum in BruheSo^ to Viell his Ef- 
quirea Tenement in Bruhell. And fo Archbifliops,Bilbops,Barons,knights, 
^ huiu(m0di Magnates ^ and fuch fort of Peercs of the kingdome had their 

Efquiers. .. ... 

In times paft eucry knight had two ofthefe waiting vpon him;thcy car¬ 
ried his Morion and Shield 5 as infcparable companions they ftucke clofc 
vnto him, becaufe of the faid knight their Lord, they held certaine Lands 
in Efeuage, like as the knight himfelfe of the king by Knights feruice. 

The old Gaulijh knights (faith Selden) fate at their round tabic attended 
by their Efqaires. 

The Germans called an Efquire Schild-knapa ,'or Shield-knanc, or 
knauc, a denotation of no ill qualitic in thofe dayes. For here note by the 
way, that Johannes de Tempribsts^ John of the Times (fo called for the fun- 
dric times or ages heliued) was Shield-koaue vnto the Emperour Charles 
the Great. Of whom he alfo was made knight, as Ver^egan affirmes in his 
Treatifc of Honor and OflSces. 

The Interpreter out faith that thefc which the French men 

call Efeuiers, wee Efquiers, were a militarie kind of vaflall,hauing im smi^ 
which is as much to fay, as that they bare a Shield, and in it the Enfignes of 
their Familic,in token of their gentility or dignitic. 

But thefe Efquires, of whom I hauc already fpoken, be now no more in 
any requeft 5 fiue diftina forts are oncly remaining of thefe at this day; 

The principall Efquires are accounted thofe that are fcleft Efquires for 
the Princes bodie, and fuch a one was Berient here interred Inter Armige- 
rosqui fiunt non nafemtur Vrimart] hahenm quamr illi ^Jirmigeri ad

borne) thofe foure Efquires to the kings bodie are chiefeand princiall,faith 
Sir H. Sfelman. The next vnto them be knights eldeft fonnes; and fuch an 
Efquire was the knights fonne in Chaucer^ who attended his father on pil- 
grimage to Thomas Bechets Shrine, as doth appcarc by their charafters in 
the Prologues to the Canterbury tales. Of which fo much as tends to this 
purpofo. 

A Knyght ther was, and that a worthy man.

But this name of Efquire, which in ancient time was a name of charge 
and office onely, crept firft among other titles of dignicic and worlhip (fo 
farre as I could cuerobferue, faith Camden) in the raigne of Richard the 
fecond. . 

In ancient deeds wc finde little mention made of gentlemen or Efquires, .

a Grant from King Henry the firft to build a religious Houfe at Colne in

died the fourth of the eight, i5ia.hauing becnc Earle of Oxford 
full fifty yearcsi a long time to tugge out, in the troublclbmc raignes of fo 
many kings, efpecially for men of eminent places and high Ipirits, cucr apt 
to take any occafion to fhew their manly prowefle: which fire of honour 
flamed in this Earles breaft,at Barnet field,where (in a mift) the great Earle

penned by that learned and iudicious Statefman,Sir Francis Bacon^Yikomi 
Saint Alban^ lately deceafed. 

The laft Earle that I findeto be hereentonibed of ancient times, is lohn 
deVere, the fourth of that chriftian name, Earle of Oxford, Lord Bulbeck 
Samfordand Scales, Lord great Chambcrlaine of England, and Knight of 
the Garter; he was commonly called littleof Campes, Caftle Cam- 
pes,in Cambridgcfhire, being the ancient fcate of the Veresy where this 
Earle vfed much to refide; He married daughter of T homos How- 

Duke of Norfolke, and died withoutiffuethc 14 of Iuly,i52(^. 

I finde in a booke of DunmoWy in bib. Cot. Maudy the wife of lohn 
de FereihQkvLcxith Earle of Oxford, lyeth here intombed : fhee was the 
daughter of Bartholomew y Lord Badciifmcrc, Baron of Leedes in Kent; 
and one of the heircs Giles Lord Badclifmere her brother. She was firft 
married to Robert^ fonneof Robert Fitz.-Paine» She outliued her later huf-

This Tovvne was famous in times paft, (faith Clarentieux) for a Caftlc 
of the Migaamfks (which now isalmoftali vaniftied outof fightj and an 
Abbey adioyning,founded in a place very commodious,in thcycarc 1136. 
wherein the founders thereof, were buried. The principall 

andfirft founder hereof, was Geffrey MagnamUiOv Mandeuill the firft 
Earle ofElTex, with Rohefiaot Roje his wife, daughter of Auh^y de Ftre, 
chiefe luftice of England, who confecrated this their religious StruiSture 
to the honour of God, the bleflcd Virgin UHary^ and Saint lames the A- 
poftle,endowed it with large rcuenues, and plac^thercin blackc Monkesj 
to which effe^ will it pleafc you readc a fcw%ords out ofhisdccdof

houfe was valued at the fupprelEon, to be yearely worth, fourc hundred 
fixe pounds, fifteene (billings and elcucn pence. 

This place is now called Audlcy End, of Sir Thomas Audley Lord 
Ghancelour, (of whom I haue fpoken before) who changed the Abbey in¬

Lying at the point of death, ready to giue his laft gafpe, (faith Camden out

willing or vnablc to repairc the decayes) carried away the materials which 
were employed to other vfes. This part of the Church was adorned and 
beautihed with diuers richftinerall Monuments, which were hammered 3

King Henry the fecond new builded this Monaftery, and placed therein

hath in the armie thc efpeviall charge to challenge vnto battell or combat; 
in which fenfe our name of Herald doth ncareft approach vnto F€cialis in

The BecUUs amongft the Romanes, faith one, were Priefts- For Unma 
Pempilim (who flouriflied circa ann. mundi the fecond King of the 
Romanes, diuided the inftitution of diuinc honour into eight parts, and fo 
inftituted and ordained eight feuerall orders of Priefts; and endowed the 
Gollcdge of thefe Feciales or Heralds with the feuenth pan of this his fa- 
cred conftitution. Their Colledge at Rome was compofed of twenty He- 
raulds, chofen out of ancient and eminent families, the t hiefc whereof (for 
excellence) was called P4reyP4/r4r«if,becaufc by being chiefc of that com- 
panic, he ought to haue children, and his ownc Father yet liuing. Their 
chiefe office was. To take care that the Romanes did not commence, and 
make vniuft warre againft any confederate Citic, and that if any fuch a city 
had committed any thing againft the conditions of the confcdcracic, truce, 
andcntercourfe, then they were to go as Embaftadours, fii ft to challenge 
their right in mildc words; which if denyed, then to prodaime warre, Ne- 
iftte iujium alt quod helium fore cenfehatur^ nifi td per Fectales ejfet indihum-. 
Neither was any warre thought to be iuft and lawful!, but that which was

In France f faith t^ndrew Favint) Heralds haue cucr beencin high

Seuen Danilh Kings, bclidcs fomc of Norway, and Sweden, haue had 
for their proper appellation the name of Herald, or Harold, which is all 
one with Heralt, faith ferflegan. So honourable was it accounted of in 
old time,that fo many Kings thereby were callc!j,in regard as it appeareth, 
that themfclues might be honoured and refpeded as the moft couragious 
of the armic. 

Heralds (faith Stovp) (out of an old Hiftory, written abouc fixe hundred 
yeares finee, which he found in the Reucftric or Treafurie of Saint Pauls 
Church) be they which our Elders were worit to call Heroesy that is to fay, 
thofe which were greater, or furpalling all men in Maieftie, and yet inferi- 
our tothe Gods. For, whom the people of antiquitie did percciue to be no¬ 
table, and furmounting all others in his ads and feates, renowned in ver- 
tueSjUnd friendly or gracious vnto them ^ him would they raagnific, and 
exalt in the higheft degree, and as it were, with their good words make 
him cofin tothe omnipotent. Placing fuch amongft the Gods, ifitfo 
were that they had wrought fome miraculous feate aboue the common 
couric of Nature. But if there were no fuch miraculous or wonderfull 
deeds, but that through their vermes they feemed wonderfull and honou¬ 
rable, then thought they to call fuch perfons, not altogether Gods, nor yet 
fimplie men, butinuented out a meane word and name for them, calling 
them HeroeSi as it were halfe-gods,and ofthis word Herees^or //&lt;pm,grow-

„ And that profice hath rifen by the aforefaid iourncy, in bringing full

Wherfor I knowing by infinite varictieof bookes, and aftiduoufe rea¬

the great, Humfryde^ Duke of Gloceftcr, and Tipetote Earle of Worceftre, 
yet conferred with your grace, they ferue as fmall lights (if I may freely fay 
mv iudgement, your high modefty not offended) in refpe^f of the daye 
ftarre. 

Now farther to infinuate to your grace, of what matters the Writers, 
whofe Hues I haue congefted into fourc bookes, hath treated oE I may 
right boldly fayi chat befide the cognicion of the foure tongues, in the 
which, pare of them hath excelled,that there is no kinde of liberal! fciencc, 
or any feate concerning learning, in the which they haue not (hewed cer- 
taihe arguments of great feliciiie of wittc. Yea, and concerning the interpre¬ 
tation of holy Scripture, both after the ancient forme, and fens the fchola- 
fticall trade, they haue reigned as in a ccrtainc excellency. 

And as touching hifforicall knowledge, there hath bene to the number of 
afuil hundrethor mojthatfrom time to time hath with great diligence, 
and no IcfTe fiich, woldeto God with like eloquence, perferibed the aifSs 
of your noble predecclTors, and the fortunes of this your Realme, fb in¬ 
credibly great, that hecthac hath not feanc, and throughly redde their 
workes, can litle pronounce in this parte. 

Wherfor, after that I had perpended the honeft and profitable ftudics 
of thefe Hiftoriographers, I was totally enflamed with a loue, to fee 
througlyallthofc partes'of this your'opulent and ample realme, that I 
had redde of in theaforfaid Writers. In (b much that,all my other occupa- 
cions intermitted, I haue fb trauelcd in your dominions, both by the fee 
coaftes and the middle parts, (paring neither labour nor cofts, by thclpacc 
of thefe fixe yceres paft, that there is almoft neither cape nor f)aye, hauen, 
crcke,or perc,riucr, or confluence of riuers, breches, wafhes, lakes, meres, 
fenny waters, mountaines, vallies,mores, hethes, forefles, woodes, cities, 
burges,caftels,principall manor places, monaftcrics, and collcgcsjbuc I 
haue (cane them, and noted in fo doing a whole world of things very me¬ 
morable. 

Thus inftruded, I truft (hortly to fee the tipie, that like as CatoIus Mag- 
nm had among his treafiires, three large notable tables of filuer, richly en¬ 
ameled; one of the (itc and defeription of Conffantinoplc, another of the * 
fite and figure of the magnificence Citee of Rome, and thethird of deferyp- 
cyonofthe world.So (hall your Maieftic haue this your !world and impery 
of Englande, fo fet forth in a quadrate table of filuer, if God fend me life to 
accompliCh my beginning, that your Grace (hall haue ready knowledge at 
the firii fight of many right dcledablc, froitfull, and necelfary pleafures, by 
contemplacion thereof, as often as occafion fliall moue you to the fight of 
it. 

Andbccaufcthaticmay be more permanent, and farther knownc, then 
to haue it engraued in filuer or bralTe; I emend by the leaue of God, within 
the (pace of tweluc moneths following, fneh a defeription to make of your 
realme in writing, that it (hall be no maftcry after, for the Graueror Pain¬ 
ter to make the like by a perfect example.

Effex is a country large incompafle, fthe circumference thereof being 
one hundred forty fixe miles) fruitfull of woods, plentifullof Saffron, and 
very wealthy, 

A late writer hauing reckoned vp the commodities which this County 
dothaffoard, concludes on this manner. 

If you efteeme not thefCj as things abouc the ground, 

Looke vnder, where the Vrncs of ancient times are found: 

The Roman Emp-rours Coynes, oft digd out of the duft. 

And warlike weapons, now confura'd with cankring ruft, 

And huge and maffy bones ofmightyfearefoll men, 

To tell the worlds full ftrength, what creatures liued thenj 
When in her height ofyouth, the luftie fruitfull earth 
Brought forth her big-lim’d brood, euen Gyants in their birth. 

Nccre to Showbery, in Rochford Hundred, arc certaine fails, in which 
the bodies of the Danes there difeomfited, and flaine in the raigne of Ed¬ 
mund Ironfide, lie buried in Effex.

DON CANONIZED Saints, 

the firft Bi(bop of this Sce,aftdr the remouall 
of the Archbilhopridtcto Canteirburyi had afhrinc 
crc&lt; 3 :ed to his honour in this Ghuteh, as I haue touch* 
•cd before. In his time, and i!&gt;Sttly by his inftigacion, 
this Cathedrall Church was built by Ethelhm King of 
Kent. He was confecrated Bilhop of London by Saint 
Archbiftiop of Canterbury, the yeare ^04. 
In the gouernment whereof hce continued ninctcene 
ycares; in which time and about the fourth yeare of his conrccration,hc 
went to Rome to conferre with Boniftee the Pope about diuers things, and 
was by him honourably entertained. A yeare or two after his returnc,dicd 
both Ethelbert King of Kent, as alfb Sebert of the Eaft Angles, whom he 
had conuerted to the Chriftian Faith. 

King Sebert left behindc him three wicked fonncB,that being neuer bap¬ 
tized, came notwitbftanding one day into the Church at Communion 
time, and asked the Biftiop what hec meant that hee dcliuercd not of that; 
fame fine bread vnto them as he was wont to their father Sebert , and did 
yet vnto the reft of the people. He anfwcred, that if they would be walbed 
in the water of life,as he was,and the reft ofthe people there prefent 5 then 
would he deliuer vnto them of this bread allb; but otherwife, neither was it 
lawfull for him to deliuer, nor them to recciue it. This notwitbftanding 
they would haue enforced him, and when they could not preuaile, were fo] 
enraged, as they expelled him their dominions,hardly holding their hands ’ 
from doing him violence at that time. Hce, being thus exiled, went firft 
snio Laurence Archbiihop of Canterbury, and finding him in little better 
cafe then himfclfe was at London, departed into France, together with /«- 
jius Biflaop of Rochefter.Being fent for foone after by Laurence^ it happen¬

Canterbury was by negligence ftt on fire, and began to wafte and confiimc 
away by much increafing of the flames, fo that no heipe ofman, nor caft- 
ing of water thereon, was able to quench or ftay the fame, the greateft part 
of the citie being at length almoft burnt, and the furious flafhes extending 
themfelues euen wnto the Bifhops place: this good Bifliop feeing mans 
heipe now to failc, and trufting onely in the aide and fuccour of almighty 
God, commanded that he might be carried out of his houle,and fet againft 
theft fierce flames of fire, piercing and flying all round about. 

Now where the,greatejft rage of this burning was; there was the place of 
Marty’rdome oftheToure holy crowned Saints.Whan then the Bifhopby 
his feroants was brought forth, andfttin this place, here he began with 
prayer fficke as he was, for he was often troubled with infirmitiesof body.

his blafls; for fcare of hurting the places right oucr in the other fide, and 
after quite quenching the flames, ceafing and extinguifliing the fire, made 
all calme and well againe. And truly this good man of God which did fer- 
ucntly alway burnc with the fire of inward charity , and was wont with 
his often prayers and holy exhortations to driue from himftlft, and all his,

About the (amc time, tnc King gaue commandcment for the apprehen¬ 
ding of Hubert de Burgo Earle of Kent, who hauing fbdainc notice there¬ 
of at midnight, got him vp,and fled into a Church in Eflcx.They to whom 
the bufincile was committed,finding him vpon his knees before the high 
A’tar,wkhtheSacramentinone hand, and a crofle in the other, carried 
him away neuerthclefle vnto the Tower of London. The Bifhop taking 
this CO bee a great violence and wrong offered to holy Church, would 
neucr leaue the King ^which wasthe third, a King indeed very re¬ 
ligious) vntillhchad caufed the Earle to bee carried vnto the place from 
whence he was fctcht5 which was thought to bee a meanes of fauingthc 
I Earles life. F or though order was taken he fhould not feape thence, jet it 
I gaue the Kings vvrath a time to Goole,and himfclfe Icifurc to raakcproofe of 
I hisinnoccncy. By reafbn whereof, he was afterward reftored to the Kings 
fauour and former places of honour. 

But the ftory here followeth, which is alfo annexed to his torabe, that a- 
bouc all others giucs the trueft tcifimony of his religious, vigerous, and 
vndaunted mafculinc fpirit, 

Vpon the day ofthcconuerfion of Saint ?&lt;«»/, while Roger^ Bifhop of 
London was at high Maffc within the Church of Saint Paul 'm London, 
a fuddendarkcncflcouerfbadowed chcQuirc, and therewith came fucha 
cempefl of thunder and lightning, that the people there affembled,thought 
verily the Church and Steeple bad come downevpon their heads. There 
came raoreoucr fuch a filthy fauour and ftinke withall,that partly for feare, 
and partly for that they might not abide the fauour, |hey voyded the 

I Church, hilling on heapes one vpon another, as they fought to get out of 
the fame. The Vicars and Canons forfboke their Dcskes, fo that thcBi- 
fhop remained there onely with one Deacon that ferued him at Mafic; Af¬ 
terward when the airc began to clcarc vp, the people returned into the 
Church, and the rentan^t imrefidus, who remained all the 

time nothing at all abafhed, went forward and finiflied the Maffc. 

Thus Roger hath a roome in this our Sainted throng. 

Who by his words and work€s,fo taught the way to heauen 
As that great name to him, fure vaincly was not giuen. 

Now for a concluG®n, ifyou defire greatly to know the greatnefieofthis 
! chriftian name of Roger ^ as the Poet here in this place feemes to tail it, god-

Happy.He was made BiHiop about thcycarcof our redemption, 630. and 
chofe Dunwich for his Epifcopall Chaircjbcing a Citie in foregoing ages, 
fpacious, much frequented, and well peopled with inhabitants. Famous 
alfo fora Mint therein, fomemcn of the towne can yet (hew of the coines, 
which arc fterling pence, with this infeription, Cittitatis Dunrvic. 

But now by a certaine peculiar fpite and enuy of Nature, that fuffereth 
rhegreedy featohauewhatit will, and encroch ftill without all end, the 
greateft part thcrcofis violently carried,a way with the wanes, and it licth 
(as it were) defolate: 

The common fame and report of the Inhabitants is, that before the 
towne came to decay, there belonged thereunto, two and fifty religious 
houfes, as parifh Churches, Priories, Hofpitals, and Chappels^ as many 
Windmils, and as many toppe Ships. But certainei): is, as appearcthby 
roanifeft and found Record which I haue fcenc (faltii sw) that eucn of 
late time, there was within the faid towne, fixe pariili Churches, twohou- 
fes ofFriers, anhoufc which had becneof Templars, two Hofpitals,and 
three Chappcis: foure of chefe parifh Churches are now of late fwalJowed 
vp in the Sea, and but two of them remaining on the land, to wit, Saint 
All Saints, The Inhabitants of Dun w'ich defiring fuccour for 
theirTowne, againft the rsgeof the Sea, affirrac that a great [piece of a 
Forreft, foractime thereby, is dcuoured and turned to the vfe of the Sea. 

In the raigne of WiSiam the Conquerour (faith Camden) Dunwich had 
in it two hundred and fixe and thirty Burgcfrcs,an hundred poorc people.* 
it Vas valued at fiftie pounds, and tbreefcore thoufand Hcrings of gift, for 
fb we readcinDomefday booke; 

In the raigne oftbefecond, as William of Newborough writeth, 
It was a towne of good note, and full fiored with Itindry kindes of la¬ 
ches. 

• A t which time when England was all on a light fire with new ftirres and 
broiles, this towne was fo fortified, that it made Robert, Earle of Lciecfter 
afraid, who with his armie ouer-ranne all the parts thereabout at his plea^ 
fiirc. 

But to draw nccrer to thefe our times,! haue read and copied out a large

Alfo there was in the faid Towne, an ancient and very old Churcb.cal-

levvcs time, and was valted ouer. And the roofe of the fame Chnrch, and 
i alfo the Iflcs, were leaded all ouer. And it was a Church of great priui- 
led°e and pardon in thofe daies, and was indowed with diuers Rents, Fe-

i and coppie; as well in Donwiche. Weftelton, Dyngle. &amp;c. asalfo in diuers 
! other places, &amp;c. And commonly there was kept a Court, called Don- 
wiche Temple Court, oh the day of All Soules, for the leuying and gathe-

Alfo there is in the faid Towne, tWo Hofpitals, the one is called Saint 
Umes, which Church is a great one,and a faire large one after the old fafhi- 
on, and diuers tenements, houfes,and lands to the fame belonging, to the

decaied and hindred by euill Mailers of the faid Hofpitall, and other euilly 
I difpofed couetous perfons, which did fell away diuers lands and rents from 
the faid Hofpitall, to the great hinderanceofthe poore people of the faid

Mi fan Dies, whereof the Church is noW pulled do wne, and decaied by the

And further you (hall certainly vnderftand, that when Saint lohs 
Church was taken downe, there lay a very plainc faire Graueftone in the 
Chancclljand when it was raifed and taken vp, next vnder the fame 
Graueftonc was a great hollow ftone,hollowed after the fiifhion of a man, 
for a man to lye in: and therein a man lying with a paire of Bootes vpon 
his legges, the forepart of the fee cc ofthem peicked, after a ftrangc fafhion, 
and a paire of Challices ofcourfe racttall lying vpon his breaff, the which 
was thought to be one ofthe Bifhops of Donwiche,but when they touched 
and ftirred the fame dead body, it fell, and went all to powder and duft.

Thefe gifts,to this Abbey, as to themoftofall others, were finally con¬ 
cluded with a fearefull curfeto the infringers thereof, and a bicfling to all 
fucb that did any way better her ample endowments: the Charter is figned

Afterone the Sacrift commingof the Norman bloud, 
compafled the Burgh round about with a wall,whereof there rcmainc ftill 
fomefew reliques,and Abbot walled the Abbey. The Bifliopof 

Rome endowed it with very great immunities, and among other things 
granted, That the faid place fhould be fubiect to no Bifhop in any matter, 
and in matters lawfull to depend vpon the pleafurc and direftion of the 
Archbilhop, which is yetobferued at this day. 

And now by this time the Monkes abounding in wealth, creiRed a new 
Church, of a fumptuous and ftately building, enlarging it cuery day more 
then other with new workes, and whiles they laid the Foundation of a 
new Chappell, in the raigne of Edward the firft. There were found (as £. 
uerfdcn a Monke of this place writeth; the walks of a certaine old Church, 
built round, fo, as that the Altar ft ood (as it were) in the raids,and we veri¬ 
ly thinke, faith he, it was that which was firft built to Saint feruice. 

But what manner of towne this was, and how great the Abbey was 
while it ftood, heare Leland fpeakc, who faw it ftanding. The Sunne, faith 
he,hathnotfcene either a Citiemore finely feated, (fo delicately ftandeth

or the incomparable magnificence thereof. A man that faw the Abbey

vpon the Abbot and Coucnc, that they imprifoned the Abbot, ftrucke 
the Monkes with the Bailiffes and Officers belonging to the Abbey, affaul- 
ted the Abbey gates, fet fire on them, and burned them with diuers houfes 
nccrc adioyning, that belonged to the Monafterie. They burnt aMannor 
of the Abbots, called Holderneffe Barne* with two other Manners, called 
the Almoners barne, and Haberdonc, alfothe Granges that flood with¬ 
out the South, gate, and the MannorofVVcftlic,in which places they burnt 
incorne andgraincjtothevalueofa thoufand pounds. They entred into 
the Abbey court, andburnt all the houfes on the north fide^ as Stables,

the end oftheHofpitallhallj alfothe Mannor ofEldhall, the Mannorof

Aflemblingthemfelucs together in warlike order and aray, they aflaul-

' chiefc luftice of Ireland.*'vpon whofc cntring, the fairc weather changed 
i fodainly into a diftemperature of the airc, and from that time there enfued 
[ great ftore of raine, with much abundance of tempeftuous ftormes, vntill 
i his dying day, NoneofhisPredcceflbrsin the times paft was,(with griefe 
be it rpoken) comparable vnto him. For, this lufticer bearing thcOfince of 
lufticefhip, became an oppreftbr.of the people of Ireland, a robber of the 
goods both of the Clergie and Laitie, of rich and poore alike; a defrauder 
of many vnder the colour of doing good : not obferuing the rights of the 
Church, nor keeping the law of the Kingdome: offering wrongs to the na- 
turall inhabitants: miniftring iuftice to few or none, and altogether diftru- 
) fling (fomc few onely excepted j the inborne dwellers in the land. Thefe 
things did he ftill, and attempted the like,miflcd by the counfell and per- 
fwafionofhis wife. 

Thus he continued his rigorous gouerncment for the fpaccalmoftof 
three yeaies;and vpon Palme funday, 134^.which fell'outto be the ninth 
day of Aprfll, went the way of all flclh. For whofc departure, his ownc de¬ 
pendants, together with his wife,forrowed not a little: for whofc death 
alfo the loyall fubie(fls of Ireland rcioycc no Icffc; the Clergy and people 
both of the Land, for ioy of his departure out of this life, with merry 
hearts doe leape, and celebrate afolcmne fcaft at Eaftcr. At whole death, 
the flouds ccafed, and the diftemperature of the aire had an end, and in one 
word, the'eommon fort trucly and heartily praife the oncly fonne of God. 
Well, when this luftice, (now dead j was once faft folded within a ftieet 
and Coffin oflead, theforefaid Gouateffe (with his trcalurenot worthy to

did others ofhis Succeflburs, tothenumber of eleuen. 
Zlmhtm figtts obfiurtu tt ignohilu : an oblcure little village, and of no

riched with the refiderice of many reuerend holy Bi(hops,fucceffiuely from 
Zddain who was tbe firft, vntill by reafon of the great troubles of thole 
i times in the Danifti warres, this See, as alfo the other at Dunwich, flood 
voide almoft an huhdted yeares, vntill King £&lt;%, the twentie ninth Mo-

in his words merrie and iocond; yet in his adions, as occafion did require,

In the fame Chappell, as I take it, Roger de sherwjng was entombed, 
who died about Michaelmas,i a 78. hauing fate thirtccne yeares.Ofwhom 
I finde little remarkable; yet he is memorable, for that in his time by an in- 
cendiarie outrage, the Citizens fet fire on the Priorie Church. The ftory is 
I thus deliuered by our late writers, taken out of Ri(hanger, the Continuer 
of Mathew Paris his Hiftory, in the laft yeare of King Henry the third. 

About the moneth of lune, in a Faire that was kept before the gates of 
the Priory, there fell great debate and difeord betwixt the Monkesof Nor¬ 
wich and the Citizens there; which increafed fo farre,that at length the 
i Citizens with great violence affaultcd the Monaftery, fired the gates, and 
I forced the fire fb with reed and drie wood,that the Church with tlic books 
and all other ornaments of the fame, and allhoufesof OflSce belonging to 
[that Abbey were cleane burned, wafted, and deftroyed, fo that nothing 
I was preferued except one little Chappell.The King hearing of thisdetefta- 
I ble and facrilcgious dcuaftation, rode to Norwich, where beholding the dc- 
formed ruines, he could hardly refraine from wares; and caufed enquiric 
, to be made of the faff; whereupon thirty young men of the Citie, as alfo 
I a woman that firft carried fire to the gates, were condemned, hanged, and 
burnt; 

It is thought, faith HoUinJhead, that the Prior of the houfCjWhofe name 
was iviUtam de Brunham, was the occafion of all this mifehiefe, who had 
I got together armed men, and tooke vpon to keepe the Bclfray and Church 
by force of armes; but the Prior was well enough borne out and defended 
by this his Bifhop. The Monkes for their part appealed to Rome, and fo 
; handled the matter, that they not onely efcaped punilhment, but alfb for¬ 
ced the Citizens to pay them three thoufandMarkes,after fine hundred 
I Markes a yeare toward the reparation of their Church, befidcs they were 
I adiudged to giue to the vfe of the Church, Fnam cuff am de fondere decern 
1 lihrarum auri, ^ *ualore centum lihrarum argenti, A Cuppe weighing ten 
I pounds in gold, and worth an hundred pounds of money. Whereby yoi 
may note, faith Speed, the proportion then betweene the value of gold anc 
filucr. This end was made by YUmgEdmrd the firft fhis Father being now 
dead) attherequeftand folicitation ofthis Bifhop. 

I His next fucceffbur William Midletm was alfb interred in this Church. 

I He reedified the famc,beingfo deftroyed and profaned as you hauc heard 
before, and hallowed or confccratcd the whole Fabricke anew in the pre- 
fence of King Edward the firft, and many of his Nobles. He departed this 
life the laft of Auguft,1288. in the eleuenth yeare of his Confccra- 

placed in this Sec ofNorwich by the Pope, was here en 
tombcd;hcwas Lord Chanccllour of England for thcfpacc offourcy cares. 
This Bifhop built the great Hall, and the Chappell in the Bifhops pallacc, 
and a Chappell at the Weft end of the Church,in which he ordained fourc 
Priefts to fing Mafle continually. He died luly the fixth 1325. 

Wdliam A^ermin likewife by the Popes authority was preferred to this 

Bifhoprickc, asappeares by the fcquclc.

was greatly defaced with a violent tempeft) the fumme of foure hundred 
markes, and obtained of the reft of the Clcrgie a great fumme to the fame 
purpofe. He bequeathed to the Chaunter of this his Church, an houfe and

Granthorpe, and Wychelwood, vpon condition he ftiould procure Malic

He endowed this his religious edifice, with fairepoflcffionsjconfccratcd

From a Cell to Saint Albans, it was aduancedto an Abbey, vpon the oc-

not endure a certainc Monkc of thehoufe, whom hce had made Arcbdea

" Weft-acre: 

Radulphe de Torneio founded the Monaftcry of Canons in Wcftacre, 
which did profelTe to lead a godly life after the example of the Apoftles, as 
is mentioned in the A^ls of the Apoftles, where it is faid, that the number 
of them that did beleeue, were all of one heart and one mindej and none of 
them faid that any thing which he had was his owne, but they had all 
things in com inon, and becaufe (as in the Charter of his gift ) he declareth 
that the holy Fathers did call this the canonicallrule- affirming, that who- 
foeuer did leadcfuch a life, was thereby made a companion and Citizen 
with the Apoftles, Therefore hec pronounceth in his faid Charter, that 
whofbeuer did infringe this his donation, or alter, or change it into 
Monkes, or into any other Order or Rule, fliould be held accurfed, &amp;c. *

after which the place did fliine glorioufly with miracles, 

Buttheflory of this holy CrofTc is more fully dcliucrcd by Capgraue., 
on this manner. Saint Helene^ faith he, hauing found the Crofle, did diuidc 
it into nine parts, according to the nine Orders of the Angels: of one part 
thereof (which was moftbefprinckled withChrifls bloud, his hands and

had by his wife before he entred into holy orders) were kept of thc Monkcs

honour, together with his ownc Countrie, hee forfooke, oncly to propa¬ 
gate the Gofpell, and came into England to preach the word of God,in the 
dales of Honorius Bilhop of Rome, Honorim being as then Archbilhop of 

I Canterbury. He was a man euery way learned,&amp; what he daily taught, hee 
carefully put in pra^hfe by his holy conuerfation, and charitable good 
workes. He deliuered the word with great mildnelTe and pleafant elocuti¬ 
on, whereby the more eafily he fubiugated his Auditors to the yoke of 
Icfus Chrift. Hauing gouerned the Eaft Angles 17 yeares, he died at Dun- 
wich, his Seat, the eight of the Ides of March, Anno &lt;^47. where in the 
Church of his 6wnc Foundation, he was firft buried^ but after a time, his 
bones were taken vpandconuaiedto Some in Cambridgclhirc, and there 
folcmnly encoffined in the Chancell of the Church there, which hee like- 
wife built. And afterwards, in the raigne of King Canute, his facred re- 
liques were remoued from thence to the Abbey-Church ofRamfey in 
Huntingdonlhire, by the procurement of Ethelftan, at that time Abbot of 
the laid Monaftcry.
