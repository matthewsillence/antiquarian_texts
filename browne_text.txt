Bi/hop H A LL’s Account of the Sacrilegu 
~ous Prophanation of this Churchy in the 
Time of the Civil Wars. 

I T is Tragical to relate the furious Sacrilege 
committed under the Authority of Linfey , 
Tofts the Sheriff,and Greenwood ; what clattering 
ofGlaffes, wh?t beating down of Walls, what 
tearing down of Monuments, what pulling 
down of Seats, and wrefting out of Irons and 
Brafs from the Windows and Graves; what 
defacing of Arms, what demolifhing of curi- 
-ous Stonework that had not any reprefentation 
in the World, but of the Coft of the Founder, 
and Skill of the Mafon; what Piping on the 
deftroy’d Organ Pipes; Veftments, both Copes 
and Surplices , together with the Leaden Crofs, 
which had been newly faw’d down from over 
'the Greenyard Pulpit, and the Singing Books 
and Service Books were carried to the Fire in 
the publick Market-place ; a Lewd Wretch 
walking before the Train in his Cope trailing in 
the Dirt, with a Service Book in his Hand, 
imitating,f in an impious fcorn,} the Tune, and 
ufurping the Words of the Litany , the Ordnance 
being difcharged on the Guild Day, the Ca¬ 
thedral was fill’d with Muskateers, Drinking 
and Tobacconing as freely as if it had turn’d 
Alehoufe.

PREFACE* 

T HE ‘Public is here prelented with thofe 
other Remains of the Learned Sir 
Thomas Browne, fo long fince promis'd ; * (and 
for which we are obliged to Owen Brigftocke 
Efy; Grandfon by Marriage to the Author .) 

a He himfelfgave no Charge concerning his 
“ Manufcript ^f T ejther for the fupprejfing or the 
“ Publijhing of them . Tet y feeing He had pro - 
“/cur'd Tranfcripts of them , and had kept thofe 
a Copies by Him, it jeemeth probable that He de- 
“/ftgn'd them for public life . 

u Thus much of his Intention being prefumed\ 
a and many who had tafied of the Fruits of his 
a former Studies being covetous of more of the 
“ like kind : eAlfo thefe Trafts having been pe~ 
“ /rus'd and much approv'd of by fome judicious 
! “ and Learned Men\ ; It was thought proper 
3 they fhould accompany his other Writings , thefe 
! being th e Taft that will ever be made public. 

We have nothing further to add , but to return 
t our hearty Thanks to thofe worthy Perfons who 
! have been pleas'd to adorn this Work by the 
I Plates they have generoufly contributed , and to 
| the Reverend Mr: Joflhua Burton, for obliging us 
I with a Copy of his Father's valuable Manufcript 
i of the Antiquities of Str John’s Chapel, now 
1 the Free-School of Norwich*

NORWIC 

In i 6 8 o. 



^ the Time of the late Civil 
Wars, there were about an 
hundred Brafs Xnfcriptions 
ftol’n and taken away from 
Grave-Stones, and Tombs, 
in the Cathedral Church, of 
Norwich; as I was inform’d 
by John Wright , one of the Clerks, above 
Eighty Years old, and Mr 1 John Sandlin, one 
of the Choir, who lived Eighty nine Years $ 

B * and. 


















a REP ERTORIV M: Or, 

and, as I remember, told me that he was 
Chorifter in the Reign of Queen Elizabeth» 

Hereby the diftinft Places of the Burials of 
many noble and confiderable Perfons become 
unknown ; and, left they ftiould be quite bu¬ 
ried in Oblivion, I ftiall, of fo many, fet down 
only thefe following that are moft noted to 
Paflengers, with fome that have been eredted 
fince thofe unhappy Times. 

First, in the Body of the Church, be¬ 
tween the Pillars of the South Ifle, ftands a 
Tomb, cover’d with a kind of Touch-Hone; 
which is the Monument of Miles Spencer, 
LL. D. and Chancellor of Norwich , who 
lived unto Ninety Years. The Top Stone was 
entire, but now quite broken, fplit, and de- 
^tprefs’d by Blows: There was more fpecial 
u Notice taken of this Stone, becaufe Men ufed 
(ito try their Money upon it; and that the Chap- 
\\ ter demanded certain Rents to be paid on it. 
He was Lord of the Mannor of Bowthorp 
and Colney , which came unto the Taxlcfs from 
him; alfo Owner of Chappel, in the Field. 

The next Monument is that of Bifhop 
Richard Nicks, alias Nix, or the Blind Bi- 
ihop, being quite dark many Years before he 
died. He Tat in this See Thirty Six Years-, in 
the Reigns of King Henry VII. and Henry VIII. 
The Arches are beautified above and befide it, 
where are to be feen the Arms of the See of 
Norwich , impaling his own, viz. a Chevron be¬ 
tween three Leopards Heads. The fame Coat

of Arms is on the Roof of the North and South 
Crofs Ifle ; which Roofs he either rebuilt, or re¬ 
pair’d. The Tomb is low, and broad, and ’tis 
faid there was an Altar at the bottom of the 
Eaftern Pillar: The Iron-work, whereon the 
Bell hung, is yet vilible on the Side of the 
Weftern Pillar. &lt; 


Then the Tomb of B'ifliop John Park- 
^hurst, with a legible Infcription on the Pil¬ 
lar, fet up by Dean Gardiner , running thus. 

Johannes Parkhurft, Theol: Profeffor , Guilfordix mtus, 
Oxonise educatus, temporibus Maris Pegina pro 
Nitida, conftientia tuenda, Tigurins vixit exul 
Voluntmus : Poftea preful faftus, fanttijjhne 
Hcmc rexit Ecclefiam per i6tan: Obiit fecundo die: 

Febr: 1574. 

A Perfon he was .of great E-fteem and Venera¬ 
tion in the Reign -of Queen Elizabeth. His 
-Coat of Arms is on the Pillars, vifible, at the 
going out of the Bilhop’s Hall. 

Between die two uppermoft Pillars, on 
the fame Side, flood a handfom Monument 
of Bifliop Edmund Scamlee, thus. 


Natus apud Greflingham, in Com* Lane: SS: Theol : Profi 
apud Cantabrigienfes, ObtiuMtati 85. am 1594 nqnis Mali^. 


He was Houfliold Chaplain to the Arehbifliop 
of Canterbury , and died 1594. The Monu¬ 
ment was above a yard and half high, with 
his Effigies in Alabafler, and all enclofed with 
Iron Gtat£. In the late Times the 


a 


high 


Grate was taken away, the Statue broken, 
( and the Free-ftone pulled down as far as the 

B 3 inward 







4 REPERTORIVM: Or, 

Inward Brick-work ; which being unfightly, 
was afterwards taken away, and the Space be¬ 
tween the Pillars left void, as it now re¬ 
mained}. 

I n the South-fide of this Ifle, according as 
the Infeription denoteth, was buried George 
Gardiner, fometime Dean. 

Georgius Gardiner Barvici natus , Cantabrigian educates, 

Erimo minor Canonicus, j'ecundo Er&amp;bendarius, tertio Arebidiaconus 
Nordovici, demum 28: Nov: An: 15*73. faclus ejl Sacella?ius 
Doming Regina, &amp; Dec anus bains Ecclejia, in quo loco J&gt;er 16 

Annas rexit. 

Somewhat higher is a Monument for 
Dr; Edmund Porter, a learned Prebendary, 
fometime of this Church. 

- Between two Pillars of the North Me 
in the Body of the Church, ftands the Monu¬ 
ment of Sir James Hobart, Attorney-Gene¬

much repair’d the Eaft End of this Church; 
did many good Works, lived in great Efteem, 
and died oAnn: 1498 or 1499* 


Next above Bifhop Goldwell , -where the 
Iron Grates yet ftand 3 Bifhop John Wakering 
is faid to have been buried. He was Bifhop 
in the Reign of King Henry V. and was fent 
to the Council of Confiance : He is faid alfo to 
have built the Cloifter in the Bifhop’s Palace, 
) which led into it from the Church Door,which 
was cover’d with a handfom Roof, before the 
late Civil War. Alfo reported to have built 
the Chapter-houfe, which being ruinous, is 
now demolifh’d, and the decay’d Parts above 
and about it handfomly repair’d, or new built. 
The Arms of the See impaling his own Coat, 
the Three Fleur des Lys , are yet vifible upon 
the Wall by the Door. He lived in great Re¬ 
putation, and died 1426, and is faid to have 
been buried before S&gt; George's Altar. 


On the North-fide of the Choir, between 
the two Arches, next to Queen Elizabeth's 
Seat, were buried Sir Thomas Erpingham, 
and his Wives the Lady Joan, Cfe. whofen 
Pictures were in the Painted-Glafs Windows, u 
next unto this Place, with the Arms of the Er- n 
gingham's. The Infides of both the Pillars 
were painted in red Colours, with divers Fi¬ 
gures and Infcriptions, from the top almoft to 
the bottom, which are now walked out by 
the Pillars. He was a Knight 












8 RETERTORIUM: Or,. 1 

of the Garter in the Time of Hen: IV'.and fome 
Part of Hen: V'. and I find his Name in the Lift 
&gt;1 of the Lord Wardens of the Cinque-Ports? He 
is fa id to have built th t ‘Black Friars Church, 
or Steeple, or both, now called New-Hall Stee- 
fle. His Arms are often on the Steeple, which 
are an Efcocheon within an Orle of Martlets , 
and alfo upon the out-fide of the Gate, next 
the Schooi-Houfe. There was a long Brafs 
Infcription about the Tomb-ftone, which was 
torn away in the lateTimes, and the Name of 
Erfingham only remaining, Johannes Dominus 
de Erfingham Miles , was buried intheParifh 
Church of Erfingham , as the Infcription ftiil 
declareth. 

In the North Me, near to the Door, leading 
towards Jefus Chaff el, was buried Sir Wil¬ 
liam Denny, Recorder of Norwich , and one 
of the Counfellors at Law to King Charles I. 

I n Jefus Chaff el (lands a large T omb (which 
isfrid to have been tranflated from our Ladies

taken down) whereof the Brafs Infcription a-

tne It imhatnh ; and in all Probability, might 
have belong’d to Sir Ihomas Windham , one of 
King Hanry VllFs Counfellors, of his Guard, 
and Vice-Admiral ; for I find that there hath 
fuch an Infcription upon the Tomb of 




a Windham m this Church.

, and according to the Number of the Three 
Perfons in the Infcription, there are Three Fi¬ 
ll gures upon the Tomb. 

On the North Wall of Jefus Chappel there 
i is a legible Brafs Infcription in Latin Verfesj 
and at the laft Line Pater Nofler. This 
was the Monument of Randulfm Puher- 
toft cuftos caronelle. Above the Infcription was 
; his Coat of Arms, miz. Six Ears of Wheat 
] with a Border of Cinque-foils; but now waihed 
: out. fince the Wall was whiten’d. 

A t the Entrance of St. Luke's Chappef on 
I] the Left Hand, is an arched Monument, faid 
to belong to one of the Family of the Bofvile’s 
or Bofwill , fometime Prior of the Convent. 

3 At the Eaft End of the Monument are the 
1 Arms ot the Church ( the Crofs ) and on 
the Weft End another (three Bolt Arrows ,) 
which is fuppofed to be his Paternal Coat. 

I The fame Coat is to be feen in the fixth Efco-

Next unto it is the Monument of Richard 
Brome, Efq; whofe Arms thereon are Ermyns, 
and for the Creft, a Bunch or Branch of Broom 
with Golden T loWers. This might be Richard 
Bronte, Efq; whofe Daughter married the Heir 
of the Yaxley's of Yaxley, in the Time of Henry 
VII. And one of the fame Name founded a 
Chappel in the Field in Norwich . 

There are alfo in St. Luke's Chdpfil, 
ntongft the Seats on the South-fide, two fub- 
ftailtial Marble and crdfs’d Tombs, very anci¬ 
ent, faid to be two Priors of this Convent. 

At the Entrance into the Cloifter, by the up¬ 
per Door on the Right Hand, next the Stairs, 
was a handfom Monument on the Wall, which 
was pulled down in the late Times, and a Void 
Place ftill remaineth. Upon this Stone were 
the Figures of two Perfons in a praying Po~ 
fture, on their Knees. I Was told by Mr. Sand¬ 
lin, that it was faid to be the Monument for 
one of the Bigots, who built or beautified that 
Arch by it, which leadeth into the Church. 

In the Choir towards the high Altar, and 
below the Afcents, there is an old Tomb, which 
hath been generally faid to have been the Mo¬ 
nument of Bilhop William Herbert, Found er 
of the Church, and commonly known by the 
Name of the Founder’s Tom b. This was above 
an Ell high ; but when the Pulpit, in the late 
Confufion, was placed at the Pillar* where 
Bilhop Overall's Monument now is, and the

Aldermen’s Seats were at the Baft End, and the 
Mayor’s Seat in the middle at the high Altar, 
the height of the Tomb being a Hindrance un¬ 
to the People, it was taken down to fuch a 
Lownefs as it now remains in. He was born 
at Oxford, in good Favour with King William 
Rufus , and King Henry I. removed the Epis¬ 
copal See from Thetford to Norwich, built the 
] Priory for 6 o Monks, the Cathedral Churchy 
: the Bilhop’s Palace, the Church of S. L 4 eonard y

Many Bilhops of old might be buried a- 
bout, or not far from the Founder, as William 
Turbus , a Norman , the third Bifhop of Nor¬ 
wich, and John of Oxford the fourth, accoun¬ 
ted among the learned Men of his Time, who 
built Trinity Church in Ipfwich, and died in the 
Reign of King John; and it is deliver’d, that 
thefe two Bilhops were buried near to Bifhop 
Herbert , the Founder, 


In the fame Row, or not far off, was buried 
Bifhop Henry le Spencer, as loft Brafs Infcri-? ot 


options have declar’d. And Mr. Sandlin told A

me 5 that he had feen an Infcription on a Grave- 
ftonc thereabouts, with the Name of Henricus 
de 3 or le Spencer: He came young unto the 
See^ and fat longer in it than any before or 
after him: But his Time might have been 
fhorter, if he had not efcaped in the Fray at 
Lennam , (a Town of which he was Lord) 
where forcing the Magiftrate’s Tipftaff to be 
carried before him, the People with Staves, 
Stones, and Arrows, wounded, and put his 
Servants to Flight. He was alfo wounded, 
and left alone, as John Fox hath fet it down 
out of the Chronicle of S. Albany . 

In the fame Row, of late Times, was bu¬ 
ried Bilhop Richard Montague, as the In¬ 
fcription, D epofitum Montacutii Epifcopi , doth 
declare. 

For his eminent Knowledge in the Greek 
Language, he was much countenanc’d by Sir 
Henry Savile , Pro volt of Eaton College, and 
fettled in a Fellowfbip thereof: Afterwards 
made Bifliop of Chichefter; thence tranflated 
unto Norwich , where he lived about three 
Years. He came unto Norwich with the evil 
Effects of a quartan Ague, which he had about 
a Yea!r before, and which accompany’d him to 
his Grave; yet he ftudied, and writ very much, 
had an excellent Library of Books, and Heaps 
of Papers, fairly written with his own Hand, 
concerning the Ecclefiaftical Hiftory. His 
Book§ were fent to London ; and, as it was

tranfmitted to Rome ; from whence they were 
never return’d. 

O n the other Side was buried Bifliop John 
! Overall, Fellow of Trinity College in Cam¬ 
bridge, Matter of Katherine Hall, Regius Pro- 
feflbr, and Dean of St.' Pauls; and had the 
Honour to be nominated one of the firft Go- 
vernours of Sutton Hofpital, by the Founder 
himfelf, a Perfon highly reverenc’d and be- 
lov’d y who being buried without any Infcri- 
ption, had a Monument lately erected for him 
by Dr.' Cofin , Lord Bilhop of Durham, upon 
the next Pillar. 

u n d e r the large Sandy-colour’d Stone was 
buried Bifliop Richard Corbet, a Perfon of 
Angular Wit, and an eloquent Preacher, who 
lived Bifliop of this See but three Years, being 
before Dean of Chrifi Church, then Bifliop of 
Oxford. The Xnfcription is as follows :

14 RETERTORWM: Or, 

Towards the upper End of the Choir, 
and on the South-fide, under a fair large Stone, 
was interred Sir William Boleyn, or Bullen, 
Great Grandfather to Queen Elizabeth . The 
Inscription hath been long loft, which was 
this: ✓ | 

Hie jacet corpus Willelmi Boleyn, militis , 

Qui obiit x Otfobris , Ann . Do?n* MCCCCCV. 

And I find in a good Manufcript of the And-* 
ent Gentry of Norfolk and Suffolk thefe Words. 
Sir William Boleyn, Heir unto Sir Tho. Boleyn, 
who married Margaret, Daughter and Heir of 
Tho. Butler, Earl of Ormond, died in the Tear 
1505, and was buried on the South-fide of the 
Chancel of Chrift Church in Norwich. And 
furely the Arms of few Families have been 
more often found in any Church, than thofe 
of the Boleyn's^ on the Walls, and in the Win^ 
dows of the Eaft Part of this Church. Many 
others of this noble Family were buried in 
Bleckling Church. 


Many other BMhops might be buried in 
this Church, as we find it fo after ted by fome 
Hiftorical Accounts; but no Hiftory or Tradi* 
tion remaining of the Place of their Interment, 
in vain we endeavour to defign and point out 
the fame.

Of the four Bifhops in Queen Elizabeth? s 
Reign, Tarkhurfi, Freake, Seamier and Redman , 
Sir John Harrington, in his Hifiory of the hi- 
flops in her Time, writeth thus ; Tor four 
hiflops in the Queers Hays, they liv'd as hi- 
Jhops flould do, and were not Warriours like hi- 
flop Spencer, their Tredecefjor. 

' ^ 

Some Bifhops were buried neither in the Bo¬ 
dy of the Church, nor in the Choir ; but in our 
Ladies Chappel, at the Eaft End of the Church, 
built by Bifhop Walter ^Suthfeild, (in the 
Reign of Henry wherein he was buried, 
and Miracles faid to be wrought at his Tomb, 
he being a Perfon of great Charity and Piety. 

Wherein alfo was buried Bifhop Simon de 
Wanton, w/Waltok, and Bifhop eAlexan- 
der, who had been Prior of the Convent; and 
alfo, as feme think, Bifhop Roger Skerewyng , 
and probably other Bifhops, and Perfons of 
Quality, whofe Tombs and Monuments wq 
now in vain enquire after in the Church* 

This was a handfom Chappel ; and there 
was a fair Entrance into it out of the Church, 
of a confiderable Height alfo, as may be feen 
by the out-fide, where it adjoined unto the 
Wall of the Church. But being ruinous, it was, 
(as I have heard^) demolifh’d in the Time of 
Dean Gardiner: But what became of the 
Tombs, Monuments, and Grave-ftones, we 
have no Account: In this Chappel, the Br¬ 
ill op’s Confiftory, or Courts might be kept in 

D old

■ old Time; for ’we find in Fox’s Martyrohgy, 
that divers Perfons accufed of Herefy were 
examined by the Bifhop, or his Chancellor, in 
St.' Mary’s Chappel This famous Bifhop, Wal- 
. ter de Sathfeild, who built this Chappel, is alfo 
faid to have built the Hofpital not far off. 

f" » 

Again, divers Bifhops fat in this See, who 
left not their Bones in this Church; for feme 
died not here, hut at diftant Places ; fome were 
tranflated to other Bifltopricks ; and fome, 
tfatf they lived and died here, were not bu¬ 
ried in this Church. .. . . ; - 

Some died at diftant places; as Bimop Rich¬ 
ard Courtney, Chancellor of Oxford, and in 
• great Favour with King Henry V\ by whom 
lie was fent unto the King of France , to chal¬ 
lenge his Right unto that Crown; but he dy¬ 
ing in France , his Body was brought into Eng¬ 
land, and interred in Weftminfier-oAbbey among 
jtfae Kings. \ 

Bifhop Willi am Bateman, LLD. born in 
Norwich , who founded Trinity-Hall, in Cam¬ 
bridge , and perfuaded Gonvil to build Gomnl- 
£ allege , died at g Avignon in France , being fent 
by the King to Rome , and was buried in that 
City. 

Bifhop William Ayermin died near London. 

Bifhop ThomasThirlby, Doctor of Law,

Sermon was preachedin the Cathedral, by Mr; 
Benedict Rively , now Minifter of S:^ Andrews: 
He was fucceeded by Dr: Anthony Sparrow, our

I It is thought that fome Bifliops were buried 
I in the old Bilhops Chappel, laid to be built by 
i Bifhop John Salmon [demoMi’d in the Time 
: of the late War] for therein were many Grave- 
( ftones, and fome plain Monuments, This old 
\ Chappel was higher, broader, and much larger 
I than the faid new Chappel built by * Rilliop 
\ Reynolds ; but being covered with Lead, the 
,j Lead was fold, and taken away in the late re- 

i bellious Times ; and the Fabrick growing rui- 
-i nous and ufelefs, it was taken down, and fome 

ii of the Stones, partly made ufe of in the building 
ijj of the new Chappel, 


Now, whereas there have been fo many no- 
\ ble and ancient Families in thefe Parts, yet we 
jj find not more of them to have been buried in 
this the Mother Church. It may be confider’d, 
Jthat no frnall Numbers of them were interred 
ij in the Churches and Chappels of the Monafte- 
&gt; ries and religious Houfcs of this City, efpeci- 
ally in three thereof; the Auftin-Fryars , the

jfor therein were buried many Per fens of both 
jSexes, of great and good Families, whereof

Feet, Efcocheons, with the Arms of the Church; 
and alfo Efcocheons with Croffes Molina. That 
thefe, or fome of them, were the Statues of 
B.ifhop William Alnwyck , feems more than pro¬ 
bable ; for he built the three Gates, and the 
great Window at the Weft End of the Church; 
and where the Arms of the See are in a Roundele, 

are thefe Words,- Orate pro anima Domini 

Willelmi Alnwyk. -• Alfo in another Efco- 

cheon, charg’d with Crofs Molines, there is 
the fame Motto round about it.

Upon the wooden Door on the outfide, 
there are alfo the ‘Three Miters , which are the 
Arms of the See upon one Leaf, and a Crofs 
Moline on the other. 

Upon the outfide of the-End of the North 
Crofs Ifle, there is a Statue of an old Perfon; 
which, being formerly covered, and obfeured by 
Plaifter and Mortar over it, was difeoverea 
upon the late Reparation, or whitening of that 
End of the Ifle. This may probably be the 
Statue of Bilhop Richard Nicks, or the blind 
Bilhop; for he built the Ifle, or that Part there¬ 
of ; and alfo the Roof, where his Arms are to 
be feen, A Chevron between three Leopards 
Heads Gules. 

The 


E 




The Roof of the Church is noble, and a- 
dorn’d with Figures. In the Roof of the Body 
of the Church there are no Coats of Arms, 
but Reprefentations from Scripture Story, as 
the Story of Pharaoh} of Sampjon towards the 
Eaft End. Figures of the laft Supper, and of 
our Saviour on the Crofs, towards the Weft 
End ; befides others of Foliage, and the like 
'Ornamental Figures. 

The North Wall of the Cloifter was hand- 
fomly beautified, with the Arms of fome of 
the Nobility in their proper Colours, with 
their Crefts, Mantling ?, Supporter r, and the 
whole Atchivement quartered with the feverai * 
Coats of their Matches, drawn very large from 
the upper Part of the Wall, and took up about 
half of the Wall. They are Eleven in Num¬

They made a very handfome Show, cfpe- 
cially at that Time, when the Cloifter Windows 
were painted unto the Crofs-Bars. The Figures 
of thofe Coats, in their diftinguilhable and 
difcernable Colours, are not beyond my Re¬ 
membrance. But in the late Times, when 
the Lead was faulty, and the Stone-work de¬ 
cayed, the Rain falling upon the Wall, walked 

them away. 

* 

The Pavement alfo of the Cloifter on the 
fame Side was broken, and the Stones taken 
away, a Floor of Dull remaining: But that 
Side is now handfomly paved by the Benefi¬ 
cence of my worthy Friend William Burleigh , 

Efq. 

At the Stone Ciftern in the Cloifter, there 
yet perceivable a Lyon Rampant , Argent , in a 
Field Sable , which Coat is now quartered in the 
Arms of the Howards. 

In the Painted Glafs in the Cloifter, which 
ihath been above the Cr ofs-Bars . there are fe- 

i ni II mm u J 

veral Coats. And I find by an Account taken 
thereof, and fet down in their proper Colours, 
that here were thefe following, •viz. the Arms 
af Morlsy , Shelton , Scales, Erpingham, Gour~ 
nay, Mowbray, Savage, now Rivers , three 
Coats of Thorpe's , and one of a Lyon Ram - 
Pant, Gules in a Field Or, not well known tq

Between the lately demolifli’d Chapter- 
Houfe and S. Luke's Chappel, there is an hand- 
fom Chappel, wherein the Confiftory, or Bi- 
Shop’s Court is kept, with a noble Gilded 
Roof. This goeth under no Name, but may 
well be call’d Beauchampe" s Chappel, or the 
Chappel of our Lady and All-Saints, as being 
built by Williatn Beauchampe , according to this 
Infcription. In honore Beate Marie Virginis , 
&amp; omnium fanltorum Willelmus Beauchampe 
capellam ham ordinavit , &amp; ex propriis fumpti- 
hus conjlruxit. This Infcription is in old Let¬ 
ters on the outfide of the Wall, at the South- 
fide of the Chappel, and almoft obliterated: 
He was buried under an Arch in the Wall, 
which was richly gilded ; and fome part of the 
Gilding is yet to be perceived, tho’ obfcured 
and blinded by the Bench on the infide. I have 
heard there is a Vault below gilded like the 
Roof of the Chappel. The Founder of this 
Chappel ,William Beauchampe , or de Bello Campo , 
might be one of the Beauchampe" s, who were 
Lords of Abergevenny ; for William Lord Aber¬ 
gevenny had Lands andMannors in this Country* 
And in the Regifter of Inftitutions it is to be 
feen, that William Beauchampe , Lord of Aber - 
gevenny was Lord Patron of Berg cum Apton , 
five Miles diftant from Norwich , and pre¬ 
fen ted Clerks to that Living, 1406, and 
afterward: So that, if he lived a few Years: 
after, he might be buried in the latter End ofa 
Henry IV. or in the Reign of Henry V* or ini 
tjbe Beginning of Henry VI. Where to find! 

Heydorfs 




The Antiquities of Norwich. 29 

Hey don's Chappel is more obfcure, if not alto- 
gether unknown ; for fuch a Place there was, 
and known by the Name of Hey don's Chappel, 
as I find in a Manufcript concerning fome anci¬ 
ent Families of Norfolk y in thefe Words, John 
Heydon of Baconfthorpe , Efq; died in the Reign 
of Edward IV1 Ann: 1479- He built a Chappel 
on the South-fide of the Cathedral Church of Nor¬ 
wich, where he war buried . He was in great 
Favour with King Henry VI.* and took part with 
the Houfe of Lancafter again/lthat of York. 

Hen. Heydon, Kt. his Heir,built the Church 
of Salthoufe y and made the Caufey between 
Fhursford and Waljingham at his own Charge ? 
He died in the Time of Henry VII. and was 
buried in Hey don's Chappel, joining to the 
Cathedral aforefaid. The Arms of the Hey - 
dons are Argent y and Gules a Crofs engrailed 
counter-changed , make the third Efcocheon 
in the North-Row over the Choir, and are in 
feveral Places in the Glafs-Windows, Speci¬ 
ally on the South-fide, and once in the Dean- 
ry. 

There was a Chappel to the South-fide of 
the Goal, or Prifon, into which there is one 
Door out of the Entry of the Cloifter ; and 
there was another out of the Cloifter itfelf, 
which is now made up of Brick-work: The 
Stone-work which remaineth on the infide is 
ftrong and handfom. This feems to have been 
a much frequented Chappel of' the Priory by 


;o R'EP ERTORIVM: Or, 

the wearing of the Steppings onto it, which are 
on the Cloifter Side. 

Many other Chappels there were within 
the Walls and Circuit of the Priory; as of 
S. Mary of the Marjh; of S. Ethelbert , and 
others. But a ftrong and handfom Fabrick of 
one is ftill remaining, which is the Chappel of 
St. John the Evangelift, faid to have been foun¬ 
ded by Bifhop John Salmon , who died Ann ♦ 
1325, and four Priefts were entertained for the 
daily Service therein: That which was proper* 
ly the Chappel, is now the Free-School: The 
adjoining Buildings made up the Refe&amp;ory, 
Chambers, and Offices of the Society. 

Under the Chappel, there was a Charnell - 
Houfe^ which was a remarkable one in former 
"TIme $7 and the Name is Bill retained. In an 
old Manufcript of a Sacrift of the Church, 
communicated to me by my worthy Friend 
Mr. # John Burton , the Learned, and very de- 
ferving Matter of the Free-School, I find that 
the Priefts had a Provifional Allowance from 
the Reftory of Vffeflhall in Suffolk. And of the 
Charnell -Houfe it is delivered, that with the 
JLeaveof the Sacrifh the Bones of fuch as were 
buried in Norwich might be brought into it.

whether they had not the like Repioval with 
thofe in the C harnell-Hou fe of S: Paul , kept 
i -under a Chappel on the North-fide of S; PauFs

three Wind-mills to Hand on, which have fince

There was formerly a fair and large, but

noured Friend Dr. Herbert Aftley , the prefent 
worthy Dean. There were alfo five or fix Copes 
belonging to the Church; which, tho’ they 
look’d fomewhat old, were richly embroider’d. 
Thefe were formerly carried into the Market- 
Place ; feme blowing the Organ-pipes before 
them, and were call into a Fire provided for 
that purpofe, with fliouting and rejoicing: So 
that, at prefent, there is but one Cope belong¬

unto by Philip Harbor d, Efq; the prefent High 
Sheriff of Norfolk , my honoured Friend. 

Before the late Times, the Combinatio n 
Sermons were preached in the Summer Time 
“at t he Crof s in the Green-Yard , where there was 
a good Accommodation foFthe Auditors. The 
Mayor, Aldermen, with their Wives and Offi¬

or ten Stairs of Stone about it, upon which the 
Hofpital-Boys and others flood. The Preacher 
had his Face to the South, and there was a 
painted Board, of a Foot and a half broad, and 
about a Yard and a half long, hanging over his 
J Head before, upon which were painted the 
; Arms of the Benefactors towards th&lt;e Combi-

r when the Church was fequefler’d, and the 
! Service put down, this Pulpit was taken down, 
and placed in New-Hall Green, which had 
been the Artillery-Yard, and The Public Ser- 
t mon was there preached. But the Heirs of the 
if Benefactors denying to pay the wonted Bene¬ 
ficence for any Sermon out of Chrifi- Church, the 
(Cathedral being now commonly fo call’d) fome

I mufl not omit to fay fomething 6f the 
Shaft, or Spire of this Church, commonly 
called the Pinacle ^ as being a handfom and 
well proportioned Fabrick, and one of the 
higheft in England , higher than the noted Spires 
of Litchfield , Chichefler , or Grantham , but 
lower than that at Salisbury , [at a general 
Chapter, holdcn June^: 1633. it was agreed 
that the Steeple ihould be mended] for that 


F

Spire being raifed upon a very high Tower^ 
becomes higher from the Ground ; but this 
Spire, confider’d by itfelf, feems, at lead, to 
equal that.. It is an Hundred and five Yards and 
two Foot from the Top of the Pinac le unto the 
Pavement of the Choir under it. The Spire is 
very ftrongly built, tho’ the Infidc be of Brick. 
The upper Aperture, or Window, is the higheft 
Afcent inwardly; out of which, fometimes a 
long Streamer hath been hanged, upon the 
Guild, or Mayor’s Day. But at His Majefty’s 
Reftauration, when the Top was to be mended, 
and a new gilded Weather-Cock was to be 
placed upon it, there were Staylngs made at 
the upper Window, and divers PerTons went 
up to the Top of the Pinacle. They firft went 
up into the Belfry, and thetTby eight Ladders, 
on the Infide of fhe Spire, till they came to the 
uppei Hole, or Window; then went out unto 
the Outfide, where a Staying_was fet, and fo 
afcended up unto the Top-Stone, on which the 
Weather-Cock ftandeth. 

The Qogk is three quarters of a Yard high, 
and one YarcTand two Inches long; as is alfo 
the Crofs-Bar, and Top-Stone of the Spire, 
which is not flat, but confifts of a half Globe, 
and Channel about it; and from thence are 
eight Leaves of Stone fpreading outward, un¬ 
der which begin the eight Rows of Crockets, 
which go down the Spire at five Foot diftance.

For my much Honoured Friend Z)r .‘Browne* 
at his Hditfe in Norwich. 

Honoured Sir , 

J V 

Y your Letter dated 27.* Sept: (which 
came to my Hands about two Days 
fince) I fee how much I am obliged to 
|rt&gt;« for your Readinefs to take into confidera- 

a tion 

f» 










a Letters between 

tion thofe things which I defired by the Note 
fent to Mr. Watts ; fo that I could not omit, 
but by this firft Opportunity to return you my 
hearty Thanks for the Favour. I refolve (God 
willing) to be in London about the Beginning 
of the next Term, and by Mr. Watts (my kind 
Friend) will fend you fome of the Bones of 
that Fith, which my Note mentioned!. 

Certainly, Sir, the gaining of Marfhland 
in Norfolk , and Holland in Lincolnfhire , was a 
Work very antient, as by many Circumftances 
may be gathered ; and therefore confidering 
the Induftry and Skill of the Romans , I conceive 
it moft like to have been performed by them. 
Mr. Cambden in his ^Britannia , fpeaking of the 
Romans in ‘Britain, hath an Obfervation out of 
Tacitus in the Life of oAgricola ; which Dr: Hol¬ 
land* ( who tranfiated Cambden) delivers thus ; 
viz. That the Romans wore out and consumed the 
\'Bodies and Hands of the Britains, in clearing of 
Woods, and paying the Terms. But the Words of 
Tacitus are, faludibus emuniendis , of which I 
de{ire your Opinion ; I mean whether the 
Word emuniendis do not mean walling or 
banking. 

Sir, I account my felf much happy to be: 
thus far known to you as I am, and that you j 
are pleated to think me worthy to converfe: 
with you in this manner, which I fhall make: 
bold ftiil to do upon any good Occafion, till I 
be more happy by a perfonal Knowledge of

courfe inclofed, came fafe to my Hands 
the laft Week, for which I return you my moil 
hearty Thanks, being highly fatisfy’d there¬ 
with. Since the Receipt thereof, I have fpoke 
with Mr; Jonas Moore (the chief Surveyor 
of this great Work of draining in Cambridge - 
(hire and the Counties adjacent) who tells me 
that the Caufey I formerly mentioned is 60 
t Foot broad in all Places where they have cut 
^through it, and about 18 Inches Thicknefs of 
:Gravel, lying upon the Moor, and now in 
^;many Places j Foot deep under a new Accef- 
w fion of Moor. 


It feems I miftook when I fignified to 
|you that Mr. g AJImole had feme Roman Coins, 
jfwhich were found in the Feans ; for he now 











Lett eb s heiwccu 


tells me. that he hath nothing as yet, but that 
Ume which Jonas Moore gave him; but my 
Lord St. John had divers, as he tells me, which 

are Ioft ? or miilaid. 


Tonas Moore now tells me, that very late¬ 
ly in dicing a Piece of Ground, which lies 
within the Precincts of Soham (about 3 or 4 
Miles from Ely) the Diggers roun 7 01 
Urnes, which by Carelefnefs were broken 
pieces, but no Coin in or neai to cm. 
Ground is about 6 Acres, and m the nature of 
an Ifland in the Penn, but no railed Heap of 
Earth to cover them, as he tells me. I retolve. 
to intreat Mr. Chkhley , (my very good Friend) 
who is Owner thereof, to caufe fome further 
Digging there ; for they are or opinion, that 
there are many more of that kind ; and then I 
fhall be able to fatisfy you better, and what is 
found in them. Sir Thomas Cotton is not as yeti 
come up to London, other wife I would have 
fent you feme of thofe Bones of the Fife, which 
X will be fure to do fo foon as he comes. 


Mr. oAflmole prefents his Service to you 
Ttfith. great Thanks for your kind Oder, defiling, 
a Note of what Manufcripts you have that 
maybe for hisPurpofe, whereupon he will lei 
you know whether lie wants them or not; to 
he hath others than what he hath formerly

SIR , 

OUR Obfervation is Angular, and Querip 
_ very ingenious, concerning the Expreffion 
of Tacitus in the Life of ^ dgricola , upon the 
Complaint of the 4 Brit aim , that tire Romans 
confumed and wore out their Bodies and Hands, 
Sylvis £5? faludibus emuniendis , that is, whether 
thereby walling or banking the Fenns is not 
to be underftood according j to the Significa¬ 
tion of the Word Emmire. 

This indeed is the common and received 
Signification, as probably derived from the 
! old Word Manire , that is, Mambas cingere , to 
^alh fencej or fortifie by Enclofpre 2 according 

to 














6 Letters between 

to the fame Acception in warlike Munitions 
and Entrenchments. | 

But in this Expreffion ftrictly to make ou 
the Language of the Author, a Senfe is to bt 
found agreeable unto Woods as well as Fenn 
and Marfhes ; the Word Emuniendis relating 
unto both, which will but harlhly be expreflec 
by any one Word in our Language, and migh 
caufe fuch different and fubexpofitive Tranlla 
tions. • i 

A n d this may be made out from the larg. 
Signification of the Word Munire , which i: 
fometimes taken not only to wall, fence or en 
clofe, but alfo to lay open, and render fit foi 
Palfage. So is that of Livy expounded b\ 
learned Men, when in the Paffage of Hannila * 
over the &amp; 4 lys y he faith, Rufiem muniendam 
curavity that is, He open’d a Paffage through 1 
the Rock; and left the Word fhould be thought 
rather to be read minuendam , a few Lines afte: 
the Word is ufed again; Et quies muniendo fef- 
fis hominibus triduo data. 

And upon the fame Subject the like Ex- 
preffions are to be found in the Latin Tranfla- 
tion of ToIybiM) fet forth by Cajaubon, Lahore 
jmpobo in ipfo Trinciptio viam munivit. And 
for the getting down of his Carriages and Ele¬ 
phants, from the Hills cover’d with Ice and 
Snow, it is afterwards faid, Numidus ad viam 
muniendam fer vices adfmovet vixque tertio de- 

' ' tnum

ikewife Sir Henry Savile, when he rendreth it

For my much Honoured Friend , 
‘Dr: Browne, See. 


Honoured Sir, 

B EING now (through God’s God-chiefs) 
fo well recover’d from my late Sicknefs, 
as that I do look upon my Books and Papers 
again, though I have not as yet adventur’d a~ 
broad, in refpeQ: of the cold. I do again falute 
you, giving you great Thanks for your conth 
nued Mindfulnefs of me, as appears by that 
excellent Note which I yefterday received 
from you, touching the Draining made of 
late years by the Duke of Holftein, it being 
fo pertinent to my Bufinefs. My Thanks 
for what you fent me from your learned 
Obfervations touching the b anking and drain¬ 
ing in other foreign Parts. I defined my* 
good' Friend Mr. 4 qA(i hmole to prefent to you, 
when I was not able to Write my feif* which 
I prefume he did do. 

And being thus embolden’d by thefe your 
rFavours, I fhall here acquaint you with my 
qConceit touching this fpacious Traft in form 
f[)fa Sinus or Bay, which We call the great Le- 
rvel of the Fenns, extending from Lynne, Teyond 
wVaynflete in Lincolnshire , in length ; and in 
abreadth, into fome Parts of the Counties of 
wNor folk, Suffolk} Cambridge, Northampton, Hun - 
I c ^ tington , 












18 Letters from 

tington and Lincoln , Intreating your Opinion 
therein. That it was at firft firm Land, the 
Sea having no recourfe Into it, I am induced to 
believe^ when I confider the multitude of Trees, 
viz. Firr, Oak, and of other kinds, that are 
found in thofe Drains and Diggings which have 
of late Years been made there ; nay, feme with 
their Roots Handing in the Ground below the 
Moor, having been cut off about two Foot a- 
bove the Ground, as I guefs ; which I my felf 
faw at Thorney , they having been digged up in 
that Fenn. And Mr' Godard (the Recorder of 
Lynne) affures me, that lately in Marfhland, 
about a Mile off Magdalen Bridge, at 17 Foot 
deep, (upon occafion of letting down of a Sluice) 
were found below the Silt (for of that Nature 
Is all Marfhland and Holland) in the very firm 
Earth, Furr-bufhes as they grew, not rotted; 
and Nut-trees with Nuts not perifli’d ; neither 
of which kind of Bullies or Trees are now 
«growing- upon that filty Soil of Marfhland, 
though it be fruitful and rich for other Vegeta¬ 
bles. The like Firr-trees and other Timber is 
found in great abundance in Hatfield Level, in 
the Ille of Mxholme , where I am allur’d from 
ocular Teftimony, that they find the Roots of 
many Firr-trees as they Hand in the Soil where 
they grew, below the Moor, with the Bodies 
of the Trees ly ing by them, not cut off with 
any Axe or fuch like thing, but burnt, the 
Coal appearing upon the Ends where they 
were fo burnt afunder: Therefore when, or 
on what Occafion it was that the Sea flowed 

\ ' '' over 



j Mr. Dugdale to Dr. Browne. 19 

\ over all this, as appears by that, Silt at the, skirt 
j of Conington ‘Demon, wherein the Bones of that 
1 Fifh were found whereof you have one, is a 
| thing that I know not what to fay to, defiring 
1 your Opinion thereof. 

I - v ' . A,. 

I (hall now tell yon how I do conclude that 
: it became a Fenn, by the Stagnation of the frefih. 
(Waters; which is thus, vizi That the Sea ha- 
: ving its Paffage upon the Ebbs and Flows there- 
t of, along by the Coaft of Norfolk to the Coaft 
I of Lincolnshire , did in time, by reafon of its 
^Muddinefs, leave a Shelf or Silt, betwixt thofe 
two Points of Land, viz: Rifingm Norfolk^ and 
the Country about Splsby in Lincoln fnr e , which 
Shelf increafing in height and length fo much, 
as that the ordinary Tides did not over flow it, 
was by that Check of thofe Fluxes, in time, 
fo much augmented in breadth, that the Ro- 
mans finding it confiderahle for the fertility of 
the Soil (being a People of great Ingenuity and 
Induftry) made the firft Sea-Banks for its Pre- 
fervatioit from the Spring tides, which might 
Other wife over-flow it. And now, Sir, by this 
fettling of the Silt, the Soil of Marfhland and 
Holland had their firft Beginning; by the like 
ExcefsofSilt brought into the Mouths ofthefe 
Rivers which, had their Out-falls at Lynne , 
Wisbiche and ‘ Lofton , where the frefh Waters 
fo ftop'd, as that the ordinary Land-floods be¬ 
ing not of Force enough to grind it out (as the 
Term is) all the Level behind became over¬ 
flowed; and as an ordinary Pond gathereth 

c 2 Mud, 




ao Letters from 

Mud, fo did this do more, which in time hath 
increafed to fuchathicknefs, thatfince th eTodike 
was made to keep up the frefh Water from 
drowning of Marfhland on the other fide, and 
the Bank called South Eea \Bank , for the prefer- 
vation of Holland from the like Inundation, the 
Level of the Fenn is become 4 Foot higher than 
the Level of Marfhland, as Mr.' Vermuden af- 
fures me, upon View and Obfervation thereof. 
And this, under correction of your better Judg¬ 
ment, whereunto I fhall much fubmit, do I 
take to be the original Occafion of Marfhland 
and Holland ? and likewife of the Fenns. 

But that which puzzles me moft is the Sea 
coming up to Conington 'Down ; as I have faid 
therefore, perhaps by your great Reading and 
Philofophical Learning you may fhew me fomq 
probable Occafion thereof. That the Sea hath; 
Upon thpfe Coafts of England , towards the 
North-weft much altered its courfe as to thd 
height of its Fluxes and Refluxes, is moft ap J 
parent from thofe vaft Banks near Wisbichel 
which you fhall obferve to be about 10 Foot ill 
height from the now level Earth, which Level 
is now no lefs in full height than 10 Foot, as I 
am allured, from the ordinary Level of the Se2| 
a s&gt; it rifes at the prefent, I 

I fhall be able tp fliew about what time ii 
was that the Paflage of Wubiche was fo filte l

that upon the River Humber the Tides flowed 4 
Foot higher than before they did, as the Com- 
miflion for raifing the Banks upon the Sides of 
that Stream, as alfo of the great Caufey be¬

Hands about 4 Days fince, with thofe 
inclofed judicious and learned Obfervations ; 
for which I return you my hearty Thanks. 

Since I wrote to you for your Opinion 
touching the various Courfe of the Sea, I met 
with fome notable Inftances of that kind in a 
late Author, viz: Olivarius Uredius , in his 
Hiftory of Flanders ; which he manifefteth to 
be occafion’d from Earthquakes. 


I have a great Defire that you fhould fee my 
Copy, before I put it to the Prefs. It is now 
in the Hands of the late Chief Juftice St: John , 
who defired the Perufal of it. In Eafier- Term 
I refolve (God willing) to be again in London ; 
for I am now going into Warwickshire ; and 
then if you be not here, I will endeavour to 
contrive fome fafe Way for conveying my Pa¬ 
pers to you: refting 


London, 29:

Your moft obliged Servant, 
and Honourer,

Altho* at this diftance you had no early 
Account or Particular of his Death ; yet your 
Affeftion may ceafe to wonder tliat you had 
not forne fecret Senfe or Intimation thereof by 
Dreams, thoughtful Whifperings, Mercurifms, 
Airy Nuncio’s, or fympathetical Infinuations, 
which many feem to have had at the Death of 
their deareft Friends : for fince we find in that 
famous Story, that Spirits themfelves were fain 
to tell their Fellows at a diftance, that the great

\l they who ftiall live to fee the Sun and Moon 
U darkned, and the Stars to fall from Heaven, 
i (will hardly be deceiv’d in the Advent of the

ther Difeafes, are feldom pretended in this; 
and we find no Sigil in the Archidoxis of Ta-

Marafmns, which if other Difeafes fail, will 
put a period unto long Livers, and at la ft

could not but think that the fiery Principle would 
wear out all the reft, and at la ft make an end

peftecl Coincidence, which made the fame Re¬ 
markable, oAntifater who had an Anniversary 
Feaft every Year upon his Birth-day, needed no 
Aftrological Revolution to know what Day he 
Should dye on. When the fixed Stars have 
made a Revolution unto the Points from whence 
they firft fet out, fome of the Ancients thought 
the World would have an end ; which was a 
kind of dying upon the Day of its Nativity. 
Now the Difeafe prevailing and fwiftly advan¬ 
cing about the time of his Nativity, fome were 
of Opinion that he would leave the World on 
the Day he entred into it: but this being a lin- 
gring Difeafe, and creeping foftly on, nothing 
critical was found or expefted, and he died not 
before fifteen Days after. Nothing is more 
common with Infants than to die on the Day of 
their Nativity, to behold the worldly Hours, 
and but the Fractions thereof; and even to pe¬ 
ri fh before their Nativity in the hidden World 
of the Womb, and before their good Angel is j 
conceived to undertake them. But in PerfonsJ

In this confumptive Condition and retnafka*

felf, and left a great Part behind him which he 
carried not to the Grave. And tlxf that Story 
of Duke John Ernefius Mansfield * be not fo ea- 
fily fWallow’d, that at his Death his Heart was 
found not to be fo big as a Nut ; yet if the 
Bones of a good Skeleton weigh little more than 
twenty Pounds, his Inwards and Flefh remain¬ 
ing could make no Bouffage, but a 11 lit Bit 
for the Grave. I never more lively beheld the 
ftarved Characters of Dante f in any living 
Face; an eArufpex might have read a LeCtiirc 
upon him without Exenteration, his Flefh be¬ 
ing fo confumed, that he might, in a manner, 
have difcerned his Bowels without opening of 
him: fo that to be carried [exta cervice , to the 
Grave, was but a civil Unneceffity; and the 
Complements of the Coffin might out-weigh 
the SubjeCt of it.

Some think there were few Confumptions 
in the Old World, when Men lived much up¬ 
on Milk; and that the ancient Inhabitants of 
this Ifland were lefs troubled with Coughs 
whep they went naked, and ilept in Caves and 
Woods, than Men now in Chambers and Fea¬

no fuch Difeafe as a Catarrh in Homer's time, 
and that it was but new in Greece in his Age. 
Tolydore Virgil delivereth that Pleurifies were 
rare in England , who lived but in the Days of 
Henry the Eighth. Some will allow no Difea- 
fes to be new, others think that many old ones 
are ceafed: and that fuch which are efteem’d

Mercy of God hath fcatter’d the great Heap of

An d they were alfo too deeply deje&amp;ed that he 
fhould dream ofhis dead Friends, inconfequently 
divining, that he would not be long from them;, 
for ftrange it was not that he fhould fometimes 
dream of the dead, whofe Thoughts run always 
upon Death; befide, to dream of the dead, fc 
they appear not in dark Habits, and take no¬ 
thing away from us, in Hippocrates his Senfe. 
was of good Signification: for we live by the 
dead, and every thing is or muft be fo before it 
becomes our Nourifhment. And Cardan^ whc 
dream’d that he difcourfed with his dead Fa¬ 
ther in the Moon, made thereof no mortal In¬ 
terpretation : and even to dream that we are 
dead, was no condemnable Fantafm in ole 
Oneirocriticifm , as having a Signification of Li¬ 
berty, vacuity from Cares, Exemption anc 
Freedom from Troubles unknown unto the 
dead.

Scarce have been married at Sparta, and thole 
provident States who ftudied ftrong and health¬ 
ful Generations ; which happen but contin¬ 
gently in mere pecuniary Matches, or Marria¬ 
ges made by the Candle, wherein notwith¬ 
standing there is little redrefs to be hoped from 
an Aftrologer or a Lawyer, and a good difcern- 
ing Phyfician were like to prove the molt fuc- 
cefsfui Counfellor. - 

Julius Scaltger , who in a fleeplefs Fit of the 
Gout could make two hundred Verfes in a 
Night, would have but five * plain Words 
upon his Tomb. And this ferious Perfon, tho* 
no minorWit, left the Poetry of his Epitaph un¬ 
to others; either unwilling to commend him- 
felf, or to be judg’d by a Diftich, and perhaps 
confidering how unhappy great Poets have been 
in verbifying their own Epitaphs: wherein 
Tetrarcba, 'Dante, and eAriofio, have fo un¬ 
happily failed, that if their Tombs fhould out¬ 
bid: their Works, Pofterity would find fo little 
of g Apollo on them, as to miftake them for Ci¬ 
ceronian Poets. 

In this deliberate and creeping Progrefs unto 
the Grave, he was fomewhat too young, and 
of too noble a Mind, to fall upon that ftupid 
Symptom obfervable in divers Perfons near 
their Journey’s End, and which may be rec¬ 
kon’d among the mortal Symptoms of .their laft 
Difeafe; that is, to become more narrow mind-

with any thing, when they are ready to part 
with all, and afraid to want when they have 
no Time tofpend ; mean while Phyficians,who 
know that many are mad but in a Angle depra¬ 
ved Imagination, and one prevalent Decipien-. 
cy; and that befide and out of fuch fingle Deli¬ 
riums a Man may meet with fober Actions and 
good Senfe in ‘ Bedlam; cannot but fmile to fee 
the Heirs and concern’d Relations, gratulating 
themfelves in the fober Departure of their 
Friends ; and tho’ they behold fuch mad cove¬ 
tous Paffages, content to think they die in good 
Underdanding, and in their fober Senfes. 

Avarice, which is not only Infidelity but 
Idolatry, either from covetous Progeny " or 
queduary Education, had no Root in his Bread, 
who made good Works the Expreffion of his 
Faith, and was big with Defires unto publick 
and lading Charities ; and furely where good 
Wifhes and charitable Intentions exceed Abili¬ 
ties, Theorical Beneficency may be more than 
a Dream. They build not Cadies in the Air 
who would build Churches on Earth; and 
tho’ they leave no fuch Structures here, may 
lay good Foundations in Heaven. In brief, 
his Life and Death were fuch, that I could not 
blame them who wifhed the like, and almoft 
to have been himfelf; almod, I fay; for tho’' 
we may with the prolperous Appurtenances of

come another Man. 

He had wifely feen the World at home and 
abroad, and thereby obferved under what va¬ 
riety Men are deluded in the purfuit of that 
which is not here to be found. And altho’ he 
had no Opinion of reputed Felicities below, and 
apprehended Men widely out in the Eftimate 
of fuch Happinefs; yet his fober Contempt of 
the World wrought no ‘Democratifm or Cyni - 
cifin, no laughing or fnarling at it, as well un- 
derftanding there are not Felicities in this 
World to iatisfy a ferious Mind ; and there¬ 
fore to foften the Stream of our Lives, we are 
fain to take in the reputed Contentations of this 
World, to unite with the Crowd in their Bea¬ 
titudes,and to make ourfelves happy by Contor¬ 
tion, Opinion, or Co-exiftimation : forftrictly 
to feparate from received and cuftomary Feli¬ 
cities, and to confine unto the Rigor of Reali¬ 
ties, were to contract the Confolation of our 
Beings unto too uncomfortableCircumfcriptions. 

Not to fear Death, * nor defire it, was 
fhort of his Refolution: to be diffolved, and be 
with Chrift, was his dying Ditty, He con¬ 
ceived his Thred long, in no long courfe of 
Years, and when he had fcarceout-liv’d the fe- 
pond Life of Lazarus f ; efteeming it enough toe

But to be content with Death may be better 
than to defire it: a miferable Life may make 
us wifh for Death, but a virtuous one to reft in 
it; which is the Advantage of thofe refolved 
Chriftians, who looking on Death not only as 
die Sting, but the Period and End of Sin, the 
Horizon and Ifthmus between this Life and a 
better, and the Death of this World but as a 
^ Nativity of another, do contentedly fubmit un- 
:to the common Neceffity, and envy not Enoch

I who being afraid to live, run blindly upon their 

I ' own Death, which no Man fears by Experience: 
And the Stoicks had a notable Doftrine to take

to come. To live at the rate of the old World, 
when fome could fcarce remenVoer themfelves

than a more moderate Period. Many would 
have thought it an Happinefs to have had their

well do without Health. The lick Man’s Sa

Consider whereabout thou art in Cehes h.

I thou arrived at thy Port. Sit not down in the 
j popular Seats, and common Level of Virtues, 
but endeavour to make them Heroical. Offer 
not only Peace-Offerings but Holocaufts unto 
God. To ferve him fingly to ferve our felves, 
were too partial a Piece of Piety, nor likely to 
place us in the higheft Manfions of Glory.. 

He that is chafte and continent, not to impair

to come ; lives but unto one World, nor hopes 
but fears another ; makes our own Death fweet

Funeral, Scenical Mourning, and no wet Eyes

If Avarice be thy Vice, yet make it not

of things blefs the Poffeffion of them, and take 
no Satisfaction in dying but living rich: for 
fincethy good Works, not thy Goods, will fol¬

well Jaid, but that it contained aljo many 
Exorbitant Conceptions in Religion, and

In his Habit of Cloathing, he had an 
Averlion to all Finery, and affe&amp;ed Plain- 
nefs, both in the Fafhion and Ornaments. 
He ever wore a Cloak., or Boots, when 
few others did. He kept himfelf always 
very warm, and thought it moft fafe fo to 
do, though he never loaded himlelf with 
Inch a multitude of Garments, as Sueto¬

a good Family. 

'I HE Horizon of his llnderftanding 
was much larger than the Hemifphere of 
the World: All that was viilble in the 
Heavens he comprehended io well, that 
few that are under them knew fo much : 
He could tell the Number of the vifible

their Names that had any; and of the

He was fo curious a Botanift, that befides

His Memory, tho’ not fo Eminent as

a New DifcoVery being made, I readily 
obey your Commands in a brief Defcrip- 
tion thereof. 

IN a large Arable Field, lying between 
Buxton and Brampton , but belonging to 
Brampton , and not much more than a 
Furlong from Oxnead Park , divers ‘Vrncs 
Were found. A Part of the Field being 
defigned to be inclofed, while the Work¬ 
men made feveral Ditches, they fell upon 
divers ‘Vrnes , but earneftly, andcarelefly 
digging, they broke all they met with, 
and finding nothing but Afhes, or burnt 
Cinders, they fcattered what they found. 
Upon Notice given unto me, I went unto 
the Place, and though I ufed all Care 
with the Workmen, yet they were bro¬ 
ken in the taking out, but many, with¬ 
out doubt, are ftiil remaining in that 
Ground. 

Of thefe Pots none were found a- 
bove Three Quarters of a Yard in the 
Ground, whereby it appeareth, that in 
all this Time the'Earth hath little varied 


its 



found in NORFOLK^ Ann. 1 66 j. 3 

its Surface, though this Ground hath been 
Plowed to the utmoft Memory of Man. 
Whereby it may be alfo conje&amp;ured, 
that this hath not been a Wood-Land y 
as fome conceive all this Part to have 
been • for in fuch Lands they ufually 
made no common Burying-places, except 
for fome fpecial Perfons in Graves, and 
likewife that there hath been an Ancient 
Habitation about thefe Parts : for at 

'' J 

Buxton alfo, not a Mile off, ‘Vmes have 
been found in my Memory, but in their 
Magnitude, Figure, Colour, Pofture, &amp;c. 
there was no fmall Variety, fome were 
large and capacious, able to contain above 
Two Gallons, fome of a middle, others 
of a finaller Size ; the great ones proba¬ 
bly belonging to greater Perfons, or might 
be Family ZJrnes^ fit to receive the Allies 
fuccefltvely of their Kindred and Relati¬ 
ons, and therefore of thefe, fome had 
Coverings of the fame Matter, either fit¬ 
ted to them, or a thin flat Stone, like a 
Grave Slate, laid over them; and there¬ 
fore alfo great Ones were but thinly 
found, but others in good Number ; fome 





A Concerning fime U R N E S 

were of large wide Mouths, and Bellies 
proportionable, with fhort Necks, and 
bottoms of Three Inches Diameter , and 
near an Inch thick; fome fmall, . with 
Necks like Juggs, and about that Bignefs; 
the Mouths of Tome few were not round, 
but after the Figure of a Circle comprefled ^ 
though fome had final 1, yet none had 
pointed Bottoms, according to the Figures 
of thofe which are to be feen in Roma 
Soteraneay Viginerm , or Majcardm. 


IN the Colours alfo there was great 
Variety, fome were Whitifh, fome 
Rlackiih, and inclining to a Blue, others 
Yellowiih, or dark Red, arguing the 
Variety of their Materials. Some Frag¬ 
ments, and efpecially Bottoms of Veflels, 
which feem’d to be handfome neat Pans, 
were alfo found of a fine Coral -like Red, 
iomewhat like Portugal Veffels, as tho’ 
they had been made out of fome fine 
Bolary Earth, and very fmooth } but the 
like had been found in divers Places, as 
DrI Cajauhon hath obferved about the 
Pots found at Nemngton in Kent , and 

as

as other Pieces do yet teftifie, which are 
to be found at Burrow Caftle, an Old

Of the c Vrms &gt; thofe of the larger 
Sort, fuch as had Coverings, were found 
with their Mouths placed upwards, but 
great Numbers of the others were, as 
they informed me, (and One I law my 
fell,) placed with their Mouths downward, 
which were probably fuch as were not 
to be opened again, or receive the Allies 
of any other Perfon; though lome 
wonder’d at this Pofition, yet I faw no 
Inconveniency in it; for the Earth being 
i clofely pretTed, and efpecially in Minor 
i Mouth’d Pots, they Hand in a Pofture

Faufiina on the Obverfe fide, on the Re¬ 
verie the Figures of the Emperor and 
Emprefs joining their Right Hands, with 
this Infcription, Concordia ^ the fame is to 
be feen in Augujiino • I alfo received from 
fome Men and Women then prefent 
Coins of PoJlhumuSj and Tetricus , Two 
of the Thirty Tyrants in the Reign of 
GaUienus , which being of much later 
Date, begat an Inference, that ZJrne-Burial 
Iafted longer, at leaft in this Country, 
than is commonly fuppofed. Good Au¬ 
thors conceive, that this Cuftom ended 
with the Reigns of the Antomni , whereof 
the laft was Antoninus Hehogabalm , yet 

thefe Coins extend about Fourfcore Years 
lower ; and fince the Head of Tetricus is 
made with a radiated Crown, it muft be 
conceived to have been made after his 
Death, and no t before his Confecration, 
which as the Learned Trijian Cofije&amp;ures, 


















8 Concerning fime URNES 

was moft probably in the Reign of the 
Emperor Tacitus , and the Coin not made , 
or at leaft not iliued Abroad, before the 
Time of the Emperor Probus } for Tacitus 
Reigned but Six Months and an Half, his 
Brother Florianus but Two Months, unto 
whom Probus fucceeding, Reigned Five 
Y ears. 

There were alfo found fome pieces 
of Glafs, and finer Veflels, which might 
contain fuch Liquors as they often Buried 
in, or by, the Times • divers Pieces of 
Brafs, of feveral Figures 5 and in one 
True was found a Nail Two Inches long • 
whither to declare the Trade or Occupa¬ 
tion of the Perfon, is uncertain. But 
upon the^ Monuments of Smiths in Gruter , 
we meet with the Figures of Hammers ,

N Off, though ‘Vrnes have been often 
difcovered in former Ages., many think it 
ftrange there fliould be many Hill found., 
yet aifuredly there may be great Num¬ 
bers frill concealed. For tho’ we fliould 
not reckon upon any who were thus 
buried before the Time of the Romans , 
[~ altho’ that the Druids were thus buried., 
it may be probable., and we read of the 
'Vrm of Chindonacfes, a Druid, found 
near Dijon in Burgundy, largely difcourfed 
of by Licet m, j and tho, I fay, we take 
not in any Infant which was Minor igne 
rogi, before Seven Months., or Appea¬ 
rance of Teeth, nor fliould account this 
Practice of burning among the Briiains 
higher than Vefpaftan, when it is fa id by 
'Tacitus, that they conformed unto the 
Manners and Cuftoms of the Romans, 
and fo both Nations might have one 


Way of Burial j yet from his Days., to 
the Dates of thele Drnes, were about 
Two Hundred Years. And therefore if 
we fall lo low as to conceive there were 
buried in this Nation but Twenty Thou-

Some Perfons digging at a little Di-

digged about Three Quarters of a Yard

of Brick-work were Thirty-two Holes, 
of about Two Inches and an Half Diame¬
